11</span>PROLOGUE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Night&rsquo;s</span> sable curtain was
soon to fall on the short-lived drama of a Winter day in the
Laurentians.&nbsp; The departing sub-arctic sun, in its last pale
glory, sent up from the omnipresent whiteness myriads of
glistening beams that stabbed the eyes like leaping darts of
fire.&nbsp; Of sounds there was oppressive absence.&nbsp; Not
even a vagrant breeze sighed in the tree-tops; but at irregular
intervals the intense stillness was smitten by the lugubrious
&ldquo;Spon-n-n-n-g!&rdquo; of some aged tree splitting open to
the heart where freezing moisture expanded in its crevices.&nbsp;
All life and warmth seemed utterly exterminated in the
pre-twilight calm save for the distant Monarch of Day slowly
receding from his stark white world of desolation.</p>
<p>Yet even in these desolate wastes Man moved and had his being;
for on the trail that wound down from the heights to the
northwest there was the ribbonlike tracing of a dog sled and
beside it the oval imprints of snowshoes.&nbsp; At a small
cleared area in the scrub timber, just above where the trail
dipped into a mighty, spruce-bearded ravine, the sled marks and
the snowshoe patterns ceased.</p>
<p>On this spot, by a camp fire in the snow, hunched an elderly
white man wrapped to his throat in blankets, beard and eyebrows
thickly frosted from the vapour of his breath.&nbsp; His face,
the wasted face of one who had <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>endured intense physical suffering,
was bereft of tangible expression; his eyes fixed dully on the
slow-leaping, soundless flames from which there ascended into the
zero-freighted air a wispy, hairlike strand of smoke.&nbsp;
Roundabout him were scattered canvas packsacks, rolls of bright
coloured woollen blankets, fire-blackened pots and pans, two
light chopping axes and a short-barrelled repeating rifle.&nbsp;
Nearby, on the trail, a spent and footsore string of sled dogs
lay flattened in the snow.&nbsp; Noses stretched to the fire,
eyes closed and limbs inert, they might be mistaken for dead and
frozen things but for the occasional faint heave of their flanks
as their trained lungs drew sparingly of the biting ozone.</p>
<p>Of a sudden the deathlike calm was shattered by the whining
crack of a high-power rifle.&nbsp; Closer by there was a swish
and flap of clumsy wings, and a dowdy, slate-coloured
<i>wesse-ke-jak</i> circled the camp uttering dismal cries of
&ldquo;Meat&mdash;meat&mdash;meat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every canine head came to life with a start.&nbsp; The figure
in the blankets winced as though struck from behind by an unseen
icy fist, doubling forward in a racking fit of coughing that
reverberated through the solitudes in listless, unsympathetic
echoes.&nbsp; The man desisted with a choking gasp, his frame
shaking in a palsy.&nbsp; Weakly he slumped back against a nearby
packsack, hands clutching at his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laddie,&rdquo; he called in a voice that was pitifully
faint, &ldquo;Laddie&mdash;oh, Laddie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His arms sagged and went limp by his sides, his breath coming
and going in the swift, sibilant gasps of a life flickering out
from exhaustion.</p>
<p>A wolf-dog in the sled pack pricked up his pointed ears, and,
straining away from his fellows, sniffed weirdly in the direction
of the stricken man.&nbsp; The treacherous huskie leaped savagely
against his <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>restraining harness, a low, ominous growl issuing from
the ugly curve of his long, trembling jaws.&nbsp; A woolly
black-and-tan of the faithful Collie strain gave a snarl of
warning; then, with bristles rising on his thick, powerful neck,
leaped at the throat of the traitor.&nbsp; That was the signal
for a general release of pentup canine irritation.&nbsp; In a
trice the whole sled pack was engaged in a furious free-for-all
of flying fur and white-flashing fangs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The command came low, deep and vibrant with a faint click of
teeth.&nbsp; In electric unison the pack flattened, cowering
silent in their places&mdash;all but the loyal Collie, which
turned with slow-wagging tail and crouching rump to express its
fealty as the scrub of the trail parted and a tall youth of spare
but powerful build strode into the camp with the carcass of a
young buck deer on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The newcomer flung the deer and his rifle to the snow and
rushed to the side of the dying man, applying a pocket flask to
his lips while he raised him on an arm with the tenderness of a
woman.&nbsp; But the elder one was sinking fast&mdash;was beyond
human aid.</p>
<p>For a few moments he rallied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Laddie&mdash;thank
God&mdash;you came,&rdquo; he murmured weakly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
the end&mdash;the end of the trail&mdash;for me.&nbsp; There is
so much&mdash;so much left undone, Laddie&mdash;so much
wrong&mdash;an erring old man should undo&mdash;but
you&mdash;you, Alexander, my boy&mdash;you won&rsquo;t
forget&mdash;the mine&mdash;the gold mine&mdash;goes
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man bent close to catch the whispered name.</p>
<p>Suddenly the invalid straightened as though galvanised in a
last brief lease of life, eyes fixed on some vision above and
beyond his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black Jack!&nbsp; Black Jack Carlstone!&rdquo; He cried
it as one who cries from the wells of the heart.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Black Jack, <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>my one true friend&mdash;you&mdash;you will see that the
boy&mdash;you will see that he carries out my
will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His torso sagged and his head dropped limply on his chest
before he finished.</p>
<p>With reverent touch the young man closed the tired old eyes,
while his own welled up and there was a suggestion of a stifled
sob in his throat.&nbsp; Mutely for some moments he remained on
one knee in the snow, stoically still, looking into the face of
the dead man as though questioning the cruel vagaries of
Fate.</p>
<p>But as quickly his expression changed.&nbsp; Presently, when
he arose and strode over to the fire, a hard, uncanny light
flickered over his face&mdash;a face whose intense pallor
accentuated the blackness of his extraordinary eyes.&nbsp; Framed
in the close-fitting muskrat cap, it was a face that bespoke
undeveloped power, strikingly handsome in its mephistophelian
mould and portending a sagacity beyond its years.</p>
<p>He stood with arms outstretched to the setting sun, for the
moment transformed to a pagan chieftain, and from his lips there
issued the single word, &ldquo;Kee-am!&rdquo; which in the Indian
means: &ldquo;Nothing matters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gold mine goes to&mdash;&rdquo; Slowly he repeated
the dead man&rsquo;s injunction.&nbsp; The lids of his black eyes
narrowed until they became slits of flame and the lines of his
mouth set close-pressed and cruel.</p>
<p>But when he turned and addressed the corpse his features
relaxed and his voice was gutturally soft and musical: &ldquo;It
shall be as you willed, my kindest friend&mdash;but, for the
present, <i>the mine is lent to me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun, now a great, boiling globe under a fanlike glaze of
scarlet, eased down upon the bleak western ranges, bordering
their purple-shrouded crests with a narrow edging of brightest
gold; hesitated one brief second in fiery farewell, then plunged
behind the ragged <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>rim of the northern world.&nbsp; Night swept with swift
stealth across the wilderness, transforming it to a realm of
spectrelike shadows.</p>
<p>A solemn hush, like a requiem of Nature for the day that was
dead, fell over the forests.</p>
<p>The lone figure by the camp fire bent forward strangely as
though gripped by an inward paroxysm.</p>
<p>As he did so, the deeps of the woods vibrated with a
long-drawn, unearthly cry that echoed and re-echoed its fearsome
notes far in the hills.&nbsp; It had seemed to rise from nowhere,
a howl neither human nor bestial, but a demoniac blending of
both; half anguished wail, half mocking laughter.</p>
<p>No prowling timber wolf broke the succeeding silence with an
answering call.&nbsp; Even the wolf-dog in the sled pack cowered
deeper in his snowy bed in whimpering fear.</p>
<h2><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>CHAPTER I<br />
ACEY SMITH</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Louis Hammond</span>, picking his way in
the rapidly-failing twilight, dodged a pot-hole in the pulp
camp&rsquo;s &ldquo;main street,&rdquo; looked up at the
unexpected sound of a woman&rsquo;s voice, and, misplacing a
foot, went sprawling into another.&nbsp; He arose bespattered and
with ice-cold ooze seeping to his ankles over the tops of his
city shoes.</p>
<p>The young man barely checked the exclamation more forceful
than polite that rose to his tongue when a lithe, girlish form,
close-wrapped to the throat in a light fall coat, stepped out to
the road from the shadowy verandah of the building that had been
pointed out to him as the office of the superintendent.</p>
<p>A big man in a reefer and high boots laced to the knees
followed, but before he gained her side, the woman turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I thank you,&rdquo; Hammond heard her decline in a
bright voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is only a step down to the
dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man bowed deferentially, lifted his narrow-brimmed stetson
with a courtliness oddly at variance with his rough garb,
followed her with his eyes for a moment, then wheeled and
returned to the building.</p>
<p>On the Nannabijou Limits, in the farthest reaches of Lake
Superior&rsquo;s wild North Shore, was about the last place on
earth Hammond expected to encounter a white woman, especially one
whose voice and every movement betokened long association in
refined environment.&nbsp; Her <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>verve and grace were the more
apparent to him as she came tripping sure-footedly down through
the half-light toward the water-front.</p>
<p>She passed him on the other side of the road, and just then
the door of a camp to his right was flung open emitting a
widening flood of yellow lamplight that threw them both in
relief.</p>
<p>Hammond caught a fleeting glimpse of an oval little face,
fascinating in its contour; of a daintily-moulded mouth and chin
and fine, high-arched eyebrows traced as with the delicate brush
of an artist.&nbsp; He looked into great darkened blue eyes that
held startled recognition; saw her lips open in a suppressed
gasp, then she hurried on as though fearful he might accost
her.</p>
<p>The time, the place and the extremely odd circumstances under
which he had last felt the magnetic sway of those eyes beneath
the unforgettable brows recurred to him as, with wildly-beating
pulse, he stood wiping the mud from his hands and clothes with
his pocket-handkerchief.</p>
<p>After her figure merged into the gloom down by the dock he
waited, despite the chill that was searching at his damp
ankles.&nbsp; Soon he heard subdued voices and the preliminary
cough of a marine engine being started.&nbsp; Followed the even
<i>chug-chug</i> of the motor&rsquo;s exhaust and a moving finger
of light from a small marine searchlight swept out and felt its
way through the channel in the immense field of pulpwood booms
that all but filled Nannabijou Bay.&nbsp; Out beyond, the boat
headed due west.</p>
<p>Who was the girl, and by what odd coincidence did she reappear
in this ungodly place?&nbsp; He wondered.&nbsp; But in the maze
of other inexplicable circumstances that had surrounded him since
the night of the twenty-third of September when he had accepted
his present strange mission, he gave up trying to guess the
answer.&nbsp; The <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>damp, oppressive gloom of a Northern Ontario pulp camp
after sundown is not contributive to romancing and Hammond had
pressing business in hand.</p>
<p>He crossed the road and knocked at the door of the
superintendent&rsquo;s office.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The command came clear and loud with an odd vibrating quality
in its not inhospitable note.</p>
<p>The room which Hammond entered, an office in the fore of the
superintendent&rsquo;s living and sleeping quarters, presented a
scene of orderly confusion.&nbsp; Its desks were littered with
newspapers, magazines and typewritten flimsies, and on its wall
shelves sprawled reference books, encyclopedias, dictionaries and
thumb-worn volumes of the classics.</p>
<p>The place struck Hammond as not being unlike the work-rooms of
free-lance writing men he had known.&nbsp; But the one occupant,
a tall, magnificently set-up figure of a man, was obviously not
of the type that put their dreams on paper, but live them.</p>
<p>He barely glanced up when Hammond entered.</p>
<p>The visitor, awaiting recognition, was struck by the conscious
power and subtle craftiness that lurked in the pale, exotic
features of the other.&nbsp; Stratagem, deep and super-capable,
might be read in the eyes, black as night, over which the lids
compressed ever so faintly now in a dreamy, faraway gaze.&nbsp;
Wide, coldly-moulded temples, under close-cropped, crisp black
hair, surmounted a face not to be put out of memory once even
casually visualised, and the whole bespoke a mind that, one
sensed, worked a dual lightning shift, analysing and sifting its
impressions ever in advance of action and word.&nbsp; The lower
features narrowed symmetrically to the alert, square-set chin;
spare beneath the rounded prominence of the <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>cheek-bones,
with a sensitive mouth that could compress thin-lipped with a
flicker in its half-smile that was cruel as sin.</p>
<p>The superintendent arose and walked slowly over to a desk and
tossed down the limp-covered encyclopedia volume he had been
perusing, then he turned and studied Hammond queerly, quite as
one might study an inanimate object while in the depths of a
mental problem, only this man&rsquo;s eyes held a ghostly,
diabolical light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hammond, what do you know about aphasia?&rdquo; was
his startling first question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a great deal,&rdquo; replied Hammond seeking to
retain an unsurprised outwardness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Refers to loss of
identity or something of that sort.&nbsp; That encyclopedia ought
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That being so,&rdquo; cut in the other, seeming to
return to actual surroundings, &ldquo;will you please be seated
and tell me what&rsquo;s on your mind.&nbsp; Smoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond lifted a cigarette from the other&rsquo;s case.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are Mr. A. C. Smith, the superintendent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Acey Smith will do out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you seem to already know, my name is Hammond.&nbsp;
I came looking for a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A job?&rdquo;&nbsp; He swept Hammond&rsquo;s raiment
with his scornful eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s so suddenly
gone wrong with the world of white collars and derby
hats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought this letter of introduction from Hon. J. J.
Slack, M.P.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Acey Smith grunted amusedly, tore
open the envelope and merely glanced at the contents.&nbsp; He
turned to Hammond with a trace of a sneer playing about his
mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indicates I&rsquo;m not to bother trying to
find out what you&rsquo;re wanted for and to slap you on the
pay-roll at a hundred a month and found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond stifled indignant surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose you
have something I can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo;&nbsp; There was something like a hiss
in Acey Smith&rsquo;s half-laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take in the
scenery, I&rsquo;d suggest.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a devil of a lot
of it going to waste hereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a mistake somewhere, Mr. Smith.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t come out here to loaf, but to tackle a job and earn
the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other smiled in better-natured scorn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say,
Hammond,&rdquo; he derided, &ldquo;what are you trying to put
over on a poor, benighted bush superintendent?&nbsp; You know as
well as the scribe angel knows that Old Man J.J. isn&rsquo;t
forking you out the North Star&rsquo;s good money for what
you&rsquo;re <i>going to do</i>, but for what you&rsquo;ve
<i>done</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond, remembering a warning, became cautious.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; he persisted, &ldquo;I would at least
like to make a show of earning the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; approved Acey Smith.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell me what you did for a living before J.J. tucked you
out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Hammond felt the need of being guarded before those
black, soul-searching eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lawyer,&rdquo; he
prevaricated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full-fledged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, student.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, hard-boiled is the only kind I could
use.&nbsp; Oh, well, if you find it hard to keep your mind
occupied you might camouflage as an extra check with the
pole-counting squad.&nbsp; But your principal business, young
man, will be doing as you damned well please, except when you get
explicit orders to do otherwise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; in a more friendly tone, &ldquo;how
was J.J. looking when you last saw him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty fit, though he seemed worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Politics is a hell of a game, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
pronounced Acey Smith.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you had better be turning
in; you look mussed up and tired.&nbsp; You bunk with the head
cook in the little shack next door up.&nbsp; First thing in the
morning <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>slip over to the camp store and get a bush outfit.&nbsp;
Those parlour duds of yours are high-sign invitations to the
&lsquo;flu,&rsquo; and we don&rsquo;t encourage
funerals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond thanked him, said good-night and turned to leave the
room.&nbsp; His hand was on the door-latch when Acey Smith seemed
to glide through the air to his side.&nbsp; He felt his wrist
seized in a grip of steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It came a hissing accusation that sent Hammond&rsquo;s hot
blood to his head.&nbsp; He flung the other free of him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, damn you,&rdquo; he answered fiercely, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m not a timber wolf either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not have explained what inspired him to say that, but
at the words, Acey Smith cowered back as one might from the
clinging clout of a logging whip.&nbsp; Hammond did not know that
a man&rsquo;s face could at one moment hold so much of evil as
leaped at him from Smith&rsquo;s.&nbsp; His head jerked back and
the eyes that darted fire at Hammond were no longer the eyes of a
human being.&nbsp; The taut lips bared back from the even white
teeth in a hateful snarl; then Acey Smith&rsquo;s hands went up
to his face convulsively, the palms cupping his lower
features.</p>
<p>He whirled on a heel like an Objibway in a war dance.&nbsp;
Next instant when he faced Hammond he was laughing quietly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drop the play-acting,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll take you up and introduce you to your
shack-mate, Sandy Macdougal, the cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are <i>sure</i> I am not a spy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied you are not what I feared for your own
welfare you might have been.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the cook had turned in and was snoring raucously when they
reached his quarters, a substantial log shack that stood directly
opposite the huge dining-camp.&nbsp; Four bunks were built into
the further wall of the one-room interior, each equipped with a
mattress and any amount <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>of dark-grey blankets.&nbsp; The
place was dimly illuminated by a sullen fire that gave out
fitful, subdued cracklings in the little sheet-iron heater banked
for the night with green wood.</p>
<p>Acey Smith lighted a wall lamp.&nbsp; Only one of the bunks
was occupied, so Acey Smith directed Hammond to the other lower,
bade him good-night and left abruptly.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>The young man did not immediately retire in spite of his
fatigue.&nbsp; Instead, he sat down by the stove, lit his pipe
and tried mentally to propound something tangible out of the
hodge-podge of mystery that had surrounded him since the night of
September the twenty-third when he had allowed himself to be
pitch-forked into a commission without definite instructions as
to how he was to act or whom he was to accept as friends or
enemies.&nbsp; Surely the whole world had not gone mad since that
hour; there must be a sane method in the whole thing somewhere,
but try as he could, cudgel his imagination as he might, he could
build up no theory that was at all satisfying.</p>
<p>Then, after he retired, came memory of the fearsome visage of
Acey Smith when he had flung him off over there at the door of
his office.&nbsp; That was no &ldquo;play-acting&rdquo; as Smith
had tried to pass it off.&nbsp; For the moment the man had been
in deadly earnest, Hammond was sure of that.</p>
<p>But a pair of great startled, blue eyes under fine,
high-arched eyebrows, came to drive all other haunts of the night
away.&nbsp; Those eyes seemed to speak at him out of the shadows,
and the fear in them took him back again to the night of the
twenty-third when Fate had literally seized him by the scruff of
the neck, yanked him out of a commonplace groove in life and
tossed him into a vortex of baffling intrigue and mystery.</p>
<h2><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>CHAPTER II<br />
A STRANGE PACT ON A TRAIN</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the night of September
twenty-third, Louis Hammond had been train-bound from Saskatoon
east.</p>
<p>The transcontinental on which he was travelling had long since
passed the Saskatchewan and Manitoba boundaries and was
thundering over the muskegs and through the rock-cuts in the
great wilderness of the Ontario divide.&nbsp; While the porter
was making up his berth, Hammond sought the smoker, but it
happened that a garrulous traveller was there holding forth on
how the league of nations should have disposed of things to bring
about eternal peace, and the young man fled as he might have from
the deadly presence of smallpox.</p>
<p>He passed on to the next coach, a compartment and parlour
car.&nbsp; The little smoker there promised peace and
quiet.&nbsp; In it there sat alone a spare grey little man with a
cadaverous face, who looked up from the book in his lap and gazed
interestedly at Hammond.&nbsp; The latter lit his pipe and taking
a seat in the opposite corner beside the window peered into the
moon-bathed night and out over the shadowy wastes to the ragged
ranges, where fitful wisps of ground aurora seemed to race with
the train like wild ghouls of the night startled from their
eeries by this mad, man-made thing tearing through the
solitudes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wild country, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice of the little grey man startled Hammond <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>from his
reverie.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is, magnificently so,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is something in its very hostile
majesty that fascinates me immensely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&nbsp; Easterner, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hammond laughed.&nbsp; The
other&rsquo;s geniality drew him out of his mood.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;ve been a westerner too, and right here I
feel sort of neutral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little grey man laughed with him, a low, sociable
cackle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he pursued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
wager you&rsquo;re not a travelling man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; a bit wearily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Newspaper
man&mdash;ex-newspaper man, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The announcement seemed to agitate the little man more than
such a commonplace announcement should.&nbsp; He was silent a
moment while he brought forth a silver card-case.&nbsp; He lifted
a bit of pasteboard from it, scrutinised it through his glasses,
hesitated as though about to replace it in the card-case, then
quite deliberately passed it to Hammond, who took it in at a
glance:&mdash;</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: center">EULAS DALY<br />
UNITED STATES CONSUL,<br />
RAM CITY, ONTARIO, CAN.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Hammond drew out one of his own cards from a vest-pocket and
reciprocated.&nbsp; The other still seemed needlessly
perturbed.&nbsp; He spoke up at last as though it had cost him
some effort to select a tactful opening: &ldquo;And so
you&rsquo;ve quit the fourth estate, Mr. Hammond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to; that is, if I can otherwise earn a decent
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>livelihood.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had five years of the
living-ghost world and I want to get clear of its grind and live
things for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&mdash;that is it?&nbsp; Quite natural
too.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Daly seemed to be feeling his way, syllable
by syllable.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know, it is almost providential
that you should have come in here at this moment, Mr.
Hammond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way&mdash;you see: I just a few moments
ago left a party who is privately seeking the services of a man
of your particular type&mdash;and he wants him right
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A newspaper publisher?&rdquo; wryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, not a publisher.&nbsp; By George,
I&rsquo;ll bring him here to meet you.&nbsp; What do you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; exclaimed Hammond detaining him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is the job and who is the man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your first question I cannot answer, because I do not
definitely know myself,&rdquo; replied the American consul.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you have just hinted to me that you would like to play
a part in big things, and if there&rsquo;s one man on the
continent who holds that opportunity for you in the hollow of his
hand it is Norman T. Gildersleeve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little grey man stood in the green-curtained entrance of
the smoker, an expectant twinkle in his grey eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; he reiterated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; agreed Hammond.&nbsp; &ldquo;There can
be no harm in meeting him anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Eulas Daly had gone, Hammond kept turning the name over
and over in his mind: Gildersleeve&mdash;Norman T.
Gildersleeve?&nbsp; Where had he read or heard that name
before?&nbsp; Somehow it seemed connected with big business and
stock market reports.&nbsp; Ten to one he was looking for a
private secretary, a biographer or a publicity agent.&nbsp; Well,
any one of those things wouldn&rsquo;t be <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>so bad, and
it would be a change from the exacting grind of the daily
newspaper where one was always behind the scenes of big things in
process, but never, never quite a part of them.&nbsp; Hammond was
twenty-five, the age of limitless discontent, alone in the world
and intensely ambitious.</p>
<p>But he was far from guessing the extraordinary nature of the
proposition that was about to be put up to him.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gildersleeve wishes to see you alone in his
stateroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond noted that much of the previous enthusiasm had gone
from the little consul&rsquo;s manner.&nbsp; His tone now was
businesslike, matter-of-fact.&nbsp; No doubt, conjectured
Hammond, he had hoped to be a party to the interview he had been
instrumental in bringing about.</p>
<p>At the door of Gildersleeve&rsquo;s stateroom, Hammond shook
the hand of Eulas Daly with a word of thanks for the interest he
had volunteered in the matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you
later and tell you all about it,&rdquo; he said, a promise,
which, for unexpected reasons, he never kept.</p>
<p>Hammond found Gildersleeve with a litter of papers and
documents scattered about him and more protruding from the open
jaws of a travelling-bag.&nbsp; He was the cut of a typical
captain of big business; middle-aged, iron-grey, with a keen,
cold face and the drift of a busy career stamped all over his
personality.&nbsp; Two tiny spots, livid white, one below either
eye, lent rather a sinister tone to his face, especially when his
brilliant dark eyes, set too close to the hawklike nose, were
looking straight at you.&nbsp; At first glance, those two marks
appeared to be birth-marks, but closer scrutiny disclosed them to
be scars.</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>He did
not offer his hand at first; just favoured the younger man with a
glance that was as swift as it was penetrating, then turned the
document on the little leaf-table before him face down and
motioned his visitor to a seat.&nbsp; When he spoke, Hammond felt
an electric urge to be brief and to the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Daly has told me what he knows of you,&rdquo; he
opened.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, will you kindly oblige me with such
detail as you think important about yourself and your
capabilities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond&rsquo;s training had disciplined him in the terse use
of language.&nbsp; He told it all in less than ten minutes&rsquo;
time.</p>
<p>Gildersleeve appraised him keenly, interestedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he approved.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll no
doubt do, provided you care to accept what I have to offer
you.&nbsp; In any case, can I expect you to regard this interview
as strictly confidential?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can,&rdquo; replied Hammond simply.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
you no doubt know, such a promise from a newspaperman is regarded
as sacred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll get down to business.&nbsp; Would you,
for instance, be prepared to undertake an assignment, entailing
little effort beyond strict caution and secrecy, without being
too inquisitive as to what its objects were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would depend on a number of things,&rdquo;
cautiously suggested the younger man.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would have
to be distinctly understood it was clean and
above-board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moral side of it need not for a moment worry
you,&rdquo; smiled Gildersleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will be asked
to do nothing that would conflict with your standards of honour,
however strict they may be.&nbsp; In fact, in this particular
case, it would be best for you to avoid even the appearance of
trickery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I knew more about the nature of the job, Mr. <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Gildersleeve,
I could better judge my capabilities of taking hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your newspaper training in mixing with men, combined
with a close-mouthed attitude will carry you through,&rdquo;
assured the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying there will
be no risks, but such risks will be largely contingent upon your
own shrewd behaviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gildersleeve gazed at the window for a silent moment, then
continued: &ldquo;The proposition in brief is this: You are to
secure for yourself a position of a clerical nature; say
pole-counter, time-keeper or office-assistant, with the North
Star Towing and Contracting Company, out at their camps on the
Nannabijou pulpwood limits, located about twenty miles south-east
of the Port of Kam City, on the North Shore of Lake
Superior.&nbsp; You are to hold whatever job you select till I
communicate with you, and, while you are engaged at it you are to
forget that you have been a newspaper man, maintaining absolute
silence to all concerned as to your past and as to why I sent you
out there.&nbsp; On these two points, I&rsquo;d like to repeat
with emphasis, <i>you must be particularly cautious</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, as to remuneration: You will be paid by me
personally on the completion of the contract at the rate of one
thousand dollars a month for such time as you put in in addition
to such salary as you draw for your work from the company
operating the limits.&nbsp; Afterwards, if you point up to my
expectations, I&rsquo;ll be in a position to offer you a berth
that will perhaps be more congenial and unclouded by the mystery
that must for the time being surround this one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about it, Mr. Hammond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond was for the moment lost for an answer.&nbsp; This
high-salaried offer, though it distinctly appealed to his
adventuring spirit, took him off his feet and the <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>concealed
object of his mission at the pulpwood limits made him
hesitate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not expected to spy on any one?&rdquo; he
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have assured you there will be nothing underhand
about it,&rdquo; Gildersleeve reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is, however, a possibility I might not succeed in
securing a position with the contracting company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is such a possibility&mdash;a remote one, but the
way will be made easy for you.&nbsp; At Kam City you will make
personal application to Hon. J. J. Slack, M.P., president of the
North Star Towing and Contracting Company, presenting to him a
letter of introduction I will furnish you with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The train slowed down to a grinding stop at a small flag
station.&nbsp; It was but a moment till it was in motion
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; decided Hammond.</p>
<p>Before Gildersleeve could reply there came a light, insistent
tapping at the door of the stateroom.&nbsp; A coloured porter
entered, bearing a sealed envelope, passed it to Gildersleeve
with a flash of very white teeth and retired.</p>
<p>Gildersleeve ripped the message from the envelope, glanced at
its contents and pushed the button at his elbow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Porter,&rdquo; he requested when the latter re-appeared,
&ldquo;how long does the train stop at Moose Horn
Station?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty minutes, sah.&nbsp; We take on watah there,
sah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, porter,&rdquo; acknowledged Gildersleeve,
passing the black man a tip.</p>
<p>He reached for pen and railway stationery, and while he wrote
hurriedly said: &ldquo;This note to J. J. Slack will act as the
<i>open sesame</i> to the job, Mr. Hammond.&nbsp; You may read it
before I seal it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond took the proffered sheet and read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>En Route to
Kam City, Sept. 23.</p>
<p>Hon. J. J. Slack, M.P.,<br />
Pres. North Star Co.,<br />
Kam City, Ontario.</p>
<p>My dear Slack:&mdash;Am under immediate necessity of finding a
berth out in the woods for the bearer, Louis Hammond.&nbsp; Put
him on at a clerical job, not too arduous, at a good salary and
charge the latter up to my account.&nbsp; Please do so as quietly
as possible, as it is highly essential that my connection in this
matter should remain absolutely confidential.&nbsp; Yours very
truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Norman T.
Gildersleeve</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Hammond,&rdquo; Gildersleeve went on as he
sealed and addressed the envelope, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll consider
the matter closed for the present.&nbsp; Sorry for the terrific
rush, but there is an emergent matter that presses for my
immediate attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He arose and grasped the young man&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; That
strong grip was reassuring, but it did not altogether dissipate a
presentiment growing on Hammond that he had let himself in for
something that was even more potential in its possibilities than
it looked to be on the surface.&nbsp; There was no more to be
said, however, unless he changed his mind and threw up the whole
thing.&nbsp; He had not the slightest desire to do that.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Outside the stateroom door, Hammond stopped dead in his
tracks.&nbsp; He was looking into a woman&rsquo;s face that was
startlingly, unreally beautiful.</p>
<p>She had risen from among the chairs in the drawing-room of the
coach, a dazzling apparition with great wonder eyes under
finely-pencilled, high-arched brows.&nbsp; For the moment he was
conscious he was staring stupidly, unable to help himself; then
her dark-fringed eyelids dropped and the faintest traces of a
vagrant smile lit up her divinely-moulded features.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>Hammond
swung hastily down the aisle.&nbsp; Quite in a whirl he pitched
into the smoker.&nbsp; The train slowed down under a sudden
shuddering of air-brakes.</p>
<p>He looked out the window.&nbsp; A sign-board on the tiny frame
building beyond the equally diminutive platform told him it was
Moose Horn Station.</p>
<p>A stateroom door opened somewhere and he heard a passenger
hurry along the aisle, out of the coach and down the train
steps.&nbsp; Next instant he saw Norman T. Gildersleeve, the man
he had just been talking to, appear on the station platform,
wearing a light overcoat and carrying a small black bag.&nbsp;
Gildersleeve looked swiftly about the area where the dull station
lamp-light and the glow from the car windows fell, then hurried
around the side of the station building and disappeared in the
shadows.</p>
<p>He had barely gone when another form seemed to rise out of the
shadows near the train somewhere, a tall, graceful figure of a
woman in sable furs and wearing a large picture hat.&nbsp; As if
Hammond&rsquo;s stare had attracted her, she turned and glanced
for a fleeting instant at the car window.&nbsp; Hers was a
savage, dark beauty with eyes so intense they glowed like
luminous discs of blackness in the shadowy light.</p>
<p>The woman went rapidly to the station, passed in the door,
remained a moment, re-appeared and returned down the platform to
the train.</p>
<p>Hammond strode out to the vestibuled platform of the
coach.&nbsp; He watched the station area closely for Norman T.
Gildersleeve&rsquo;s return.&nbsp; But Gildersleeve did not come
back.</p>
<p>The engine&rsquo;s bell sounded.</p>
<p>Hammond thought of his berth, but some movement within drew
his gaze through the glass door of the compartment coach.&nbsp;
The door of Gildersleeve&rsquo;s stateroom <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>was open, and
the little grey man, Eulas Daly, passed in, closing the door
behind him.&nbsp; Hammond was sure Gildersleeve was not with him
and that he could not have preceded him.</p>
<p>The young man was about to leave when a silent form emerged
from the shadow near the coach door.&nbsp; It was the wonderful
girl he had seen in the drawing-room, but there was great
perplexity in her face now.&nbsp; The train was rapidly
accumulating the even roar of its maximum speed.</p>
<p>The girl looked back and her eyes met Hammond&rsquo;s beyond
the glass of the platform door.&nbsp; Her hand went to her lips
as though to stifle a cry that trembled there.&nbsp; The fright
registered upon her face went to him like the stab of a
knife.&nbsp; Plainly, he was the cause of that fright.&nbsp;
Mystified, and somehow deeply hurt, he drew back into the shadows
and she fled like one fearing for her life.</p>
<p>With confusion still upon him, Hammond hurried to his berth in
the pullman.</p>

33</span>CHAPTER III<br />
&ldquo;HONOUR SINKS WHERE COMMERCE LONG PREVAILS&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning the events of the
previous evening all seemed to Hammond like a hazy dream.&nbsp;
Only the sealed letter from Gildersleeve to Hon. J. J. Slack,
M.P., president of the North Star Towing and Contracting Company,
smacked of tangibility, for he saw nothing further of
Gildersleeve, the girl with the high-arched eyebrows or even the
U.S. consul, Eulas Daly.&nbsp; His sense of good form prevented
him from prowling back through the compartment coach, and he was
really pressed for time to dress and breakfast before the train
pulled into Kam City.</p>
<p>His first experience was a disappointment.&nbsp; At the head
office of the North Star Company he was informed that Hon. J. J.
Slack was away at the Dominion capital on business, but would
possibly be back before noon of the following day.&nbsp; He had
therefore a wait of two days in the lakeport city.</p>
<p>Hammond improved his time by paying a visit to the sites of
two enormous pulp and paper mills under course of construction
near the water front.&nbsp; There was a curious rivalry of big
interests told of there.&nbsp; The young man was the more
interested on learning that one of these plants, the Kam City
Pulp and Paper mill, was to derive its supply of pulp poles
almost exclusively from the Nannabijou Limits, the largest in all
the North, a government block on which the Kam City Company had
secured <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>conditional rights to the timber that very summer after
a long legal battle with competitors and the signing of a hard
and fast agreement with the Ontario government that their mill
must be running to full capacity, manufacturing paper from wood
cut on the Nannabijou Limits by October the twenty-third of that
very year.&nbsp; In case they were not in a position to do so
from any cause whatsoever they stood to lose all rights to the
timber.</p>
<p>The stories which Hammond gained from various sources
regarding this situation were conflicting and at best rather
incoherent.&nbsp; Out of it all he gathered that it was the
result of a war between two highly capitalised organisations to
gain the supremacy.&nbsp; It seemed that originally both the
North Star Company and the Kam City Company were applicants for
the cutting rights on the Nannabijou, and because a pledge had
been made by the government during an election campaign that not
one pole might be cut and carried away from the limits unless it
were manufactured into paper in Kam City, both companies, to
prove their good faith, had purchased sites in Kam City and had
started the building of their mills before their applications
went in.&nbsp; The North Star Company was finally awarded the
rights to the limits on an explicit agreement that they were to
have their mill in full operation the following October.&nbsp;
There was an additional stipulation that in order to renew their
yearly rights on October the twenty-third they must commence the
installation of their machinery by June the first.&nbsp; This
latter clause, it was said, was added because of the North
Star&rsquo;s reputation for trickery, the government being
determined that whoever cut the poles on the Nannabijou must be
making paper from them on the specified date, October the
twenty-third.</p>
<p>The North Star had immediately commenced cutting operations on
the limits.&nbsp; The construction of their mill <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>too was
rushed, but June rolled around without them having received any
machinery to install in it.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Kam City
Company, who had gone on with their mill just the same as if they
held the contract, were getting their machinery on the ground and
had actually commenced the installation of some of it.&nbsp; The
Kam City Company immediately made a second application for the
cutting rights on the limits, claiming that the North Star
Company had forfeited theirs through non-performance of
contract.&nbsp; Then there ensued a battle royal in the courts
and before the legislature.</p>
<p>There were weeks of lobbying, during which Slack, the
president of the North Star, and a bevy of lawyers representing
that company endeavoured to hold the cutting rights and gain an
extension of time till the North Star completed their mill,
making the claim, which may or may not have been true, that they
could not secure delivery of the paper-making machinery on order
on account of the steel famine which then existed.&nbsp; But the
provincial government obstinately stood out for the terms of the
agreement.&nbsp; Slack was seeking to bring higher political
pressure to bear from Ottawa when the Kam City Company&rsquo;s
application was granted, their cutting rights to obtain from the
date the North Star&rsquo;s expired, October twenty-third,
conditional that their mill should be in full operation on that
date.&nbsp; In order that they might have wood to grind, an
additional fiat was issued constraining the North Star to make
delivery of their cut on the limits to the mill of the Kam City
Company, at a price to be fixed by a commission, in sufficient
time for the latter to commence operations, and in sufficient
quantities to keep the said mills running during the subsequent
winter months.&nbsp; On the twenty-third, the North Star were to
surrender the limits to the Kam City organisation.</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Then a
strange thing happened.&nbsp; The North Star Company suddenly
changed their tactics, bowed to the decree of the government and
withdrew all their suits in the courts of law.&nbsp; Almost
simultaneously, a number of members, who were known to be under
the thumb of the North Star, brought down a rider to be inserted
in the agreement with the Kam City Company to the effect that if
the latter company, for any cause whatsoever, failed to have
their mill in full operation by October the twenty-third and
every prospect of continuous operation from then on, their rights
should be cancelled and the same rights revert to the original
holders, the North Star Company, the latter in such a case to get
an extension of time for the installation of their machinery at
their mill.</p>
<p>The Kam City Company&rsquo;s lawyers made a brilliant battle
for relief from this rider, which, they pointed out, would
nullify their hard-won rights in case of unforeseen exigencies or
accident.&nbsp; The North Star&rsquo;s representatives pointed
out that the North Star Company had had their rights cancelled on
this very basis, and what had been considered fair treatment of
one company should be fair to another.&nbsp; The government,
tired of haggling and secretly fearing to further antagonise the
powerful North Star Company, made the rider law which the Kam
City Company must agree to live up to.</p>
<p>Thus was brought about the curious situation wherein the North
Star Company, with a mill of their own practically completed
except for the installation of machinery, were forced to cut and
deliver wood from the Nannabijou for their rival.&nbsp; On the
other hand, the Kam City Company had also to accept this system
for the time being whether they liked it or not.&nbsp; It was
obvious that they did so because they could not help themselves;
they had to have millions of poles ready for immediate delivery
<a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>at their
city docks in time to live up to their agreement, and the North
Star Company owned all the available tugs and machinery so
necessary to rush the poles to the mill site.</p>
<p>For once it was believed that a coup had been put over on the
wily North Star Company, but they took their medicine without
murmur, and not only went on with the cutting and booming of
poles at the limits as before, but rushed the completion of their
huge pulp mill building.&nbsp; People wondered what they hoped to
do with it, because the Nannabijou Limits now secured by the Kam
City Company would give the latter the full advantage in
paper-making competition, not only because they were by far the
largest limits in the North, but because they were drained by the
mighty Nannabijou River and its tributaries, simplifying the
matter of transporting the poles to the lake-front from far
inland.&nbsp; It was true that three other limits on the North
Shore were controlled by companies believed to be subsidiaries of
the North Star, but they were infinitely small in area compared
with the Nannabijou forests.</p>
<p>At any rate, the two big pulp and paper mills were on their
way and Kam City was getting the benefit of construction work
that would total somewhere in the neighbourhood of six or seven
million dollars, and the public, as usual, was mostly concerned
with the wealth immediately in sight.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Hammond incidentally gathered from what he heard here and
there that Hon. J. J. Slack, M.P., president of the North Star
Company, was a big man in Kam City, but he also discovered a
general impression abroad that he was really a
figure-head&mdash;that his every move in the commercial world was
dictated by a power behind, <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>mysterious as it was ingenious and
powerful.&nbsp; Even the policies which he espoused in the House
of Commons were attributed to master minds somewhere back of the
scenes.&nbsp; No one had ever been able to place a finger on the
source of his inspiration, but wiseacre socialist leaders
maintained it was that much-abused, vague quantity known as
&ldquo;the big interests,&rdquo; and the mob were contented to
accept it as a good enough theory.</p>
<p>Hon. J. J. Slack, M.P., who held a place in the cabinet at
Ottawa without portfolio, it seemed, was a tricky politician, a
hail fellow and well met&mdash;and nothing more.&nbsp; Before his
election to the Commons he was a struggling barrister whose
battle for a mere existence was a case of Greek meet Greek;
afterwards, he suddenly blossomed forth as president of the North
Star Towing and Contracting Company, which those on the inside
claimed was the parent of some twenty-seven flourishing
subsidiary enterprises, including a fleet of grain-carrying
freighters on the upper lakes, a grain storage trust operating
elevators half way across the continent, a fur-trading company
that had gradually dominated the adjacent districts to the
exclusion of all rivals and a string of powerful newspapers in
various cities and towns all the way from the head of the great
lakes to the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>The North Star Towing and Contracting Company and its leading
subsidiaries had at one time and another been accused of the
boldest commercial piracies, gigantic briberies and glaring
steals.&nbsp; If there was a big campaign &ldquo;barrel&rdquo; in
evidence during an election it was usually set down as North Star
money&mdash;and always, it seemed, the men the North Star backed
had the most votes when the ballot counting was over.&nbsp; But
never did the North Star Company or its satellites appear in the
courts of law as defendants or face a commission of
inquiry.&nbsp; There were settlements of a quiet nature&mdash;if
<a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>there had
to be.&nbsp; They wielded a long arm of retribution when their
self-appropriated privileges were interfered with&mdash;wielded
it with such cunning and far-reaching effect that even powerful
rival corporations and high government officials learned, not
without cost to themselves at times, it was the better part of
wisdom not to stand in their way.</p>
<p>Whose money financed this sinister business only the
company&rsquo;s bankers knew, and what they knew they did not
tell.&nbsp; The business seemed in some mysterious manner to run
itself&mdash;so successfully that it reached out and dominated
what it pleased, with an uncanny penchant for stamping out rivals
and smashing all opposition in its path.&nbsp; Its progress and
expansion had a certainty and a swiftness of a thing on the
tables of destiny.&nbsp; Its sub-managers were all reputed to be
clever rogues, deliberately chosen because past performances had
given proof that a working conscience was the least of their
moral burdens.&nbsp; Strange to say, none of them had even been
known to double-cross the North Star subsidiary for which he
worked.&nbsp; Perhaps this, in a sense, was due to a knowledge
that nowhere else could they secure positions so lucrative or
power of a kind such as they wielded under Slack.&nbsp; But more
likely there was a deeper reason; a sense of an unseen guiding
mind whom none could name but all felt&mdash;a power in the
background that could make and unmake, could create and destroy
at its pleasure.</p>
<p>Slack&rsquo;s sudden ascension to command of all the varied
industries dominated by the North Star interests was at first
lightly taken.&nbsp; Merely a figurehead president appointed for
political strategy, every one said.&nbsp; All of which feazed the
Hon. J. J. Slack not the least.&nbsp; He went smilingly on his
way accumulating millions, quite contented to be under-rated in
the matter of personal ability.&nbsp; The executives of the North
Star and its <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>subsidiaries soon learned in a quiet but effective
manner that Slack&rsquo;s word was law; that, wherever his
counsels might come from, he was at all times clothed with
absolute executive authority.</p>
<p>The thing that puzzled the gossiping public was why the North
Star Company had been so willing to cut and deliver the poles
from the Nannabijou Limits for their hated rival, the Kam City
Pulp and Paper Mills.&nbsp; With an almost exclusive monopoly on
towing and loading equipment, they could have been almost certain
of tying up delivery to the Kam City Company for an indefinite
period by simply ceasing operations on the Nannabijou till
long-drawn-out action in the courts forced them to abide by what
was in a legal sense unprecedented action on the part of the
government.&nbsp; Instead, the North Star carried on their
cutting and booming as before.&nbsp; By many this was looked on
as portentous; the North Star&rsquo;s quiet submission was too
obvious to be natural and without deeper designs, as was also the
fact that, though they had not even yet received their machinery,
they were going on with the completion of their pulp and paper
mill building.&nbsp; But more ominous than any was the editorial
silence of the North Star newspapers on this particular
question.&nbsp; From the day that the North Star changed its
tactics before the government, the newspapers currently believed
to be under control of the North Star never again so much as
mentioned the matter of the cutting rights on the Nannabijou
Limits.</p>
<p>Goose-bone prophets foresaw the utter elimination of the North
Star coming.&nbsp; It was a situation analogous to that of a
great general ordering his heaviest guns to cease firing and
retire at a time when petty strategists conceive that victory
could be gained only by continued attack.</p>
<h3><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>III</h3>
<p>Hammond saw plainly enough now that through his deal on the
train with Norman T. Gildersleeve he had tumbled in a small way
into the vortex of big things, and he had a notion that for the
next few weeks at least he was not going to suffer from
monotony.&nbsp; Gildersleeeve must be in some manner financially
interested, but no one with whom Hammond came in contact could
throw any light on that phase of the situation.&nbsp; A man named
Duff, of Toronto, they said, was president of the Kam City Pulp
and Paper Mills, backed by international capital in which
American financial interests held control.&nbsp; A man named
Norman T. Gildersleeve had at one time been a big factor in the
North, but he had long since been driven out of business in
Canada by the irrepressible North Star.&nbsp; No, it
couldn&rsquo;t be he&mdash;he had surely had enough of
&ldquo;bucking&rdquo; the North Star.</p>
<p>Hammond was bound to find out, if he could do so without
arousing suspicion as to his interest in the matter.&nbsp;
Perhaps Slack would drop some hint of Gildersleeve&rsquo;s
identity when he saw him.</p>
<p>But Slack did no such thing.&nbsp; Hammond was among the first
to interview the politician on his return from Ottawa.</p>
<p>Hon. J. J. Slack, M.P., was a big man physically, handsome in
a plump, comfortable way, urbane and pleasing of
address&mdash;almost oily.&nbsp; His face registered acute
surprise as he sat across the desk from Hammond in his private
office reading Gildersleeve&rsquo;s brief letter of
introduction.&nbsp; He actually seemed to be trying to conceal
great perturbation, but he made no comment, and to
Hammond&rsquo;s adroitly thrown out feelers for information
regarding Gildersleeve he made guarded, <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>unsatisfying
replies.&nbsp; All of which is second-nature with a seasoned
politician.</p>
<p>He did not call a stenographer, but scrawled out something on
a letterhead and sealed it in an official envelope.&nbsp; Then he
wrote a couple of words across the face of a card he took from a
drawer of his desk and handed both to his visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am delighted to comply with Mr. Gildersleeve&rsquo;s
request,&rdquo; he observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the envelope is a
letter of introduction to Mr. A. C. Smith, superintendent for the
North Star Company at the Nannabijou Limits, Mr. Hammond.&nbsp;
The card is a pass which will take care of your transportation
out on any of the tugs leaving our local docks this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was pleasant and smiling about it, but his abrupt rising
from his seat intimated that the interview was at an end.&nbsp;
Hammond thanked him for his courtesy and hurried to the dock.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>Later that same afternoon a messenger boy entered
Slack&rsquo;s private office and delivered to him a sealed yellow
envelope.&nbsp; It contained a marconigram in code, which, after
some moments of patient study, Slack deciphered as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Be prepared sensational news.&nbsp; Authorise
papers print verbatim all despatches signed Musson.&nbsp; Keep
strict watchout and wire explicit details regarding all strangers
seeking to get to limits.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(Sgd.) &ldquo;J.C.X.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slack&rsquo;s fat hands trembled.&nbsp; His face became red
and white by turns like one who has been discovered in a grievous
blunder.&nbsp; He jabbed excitedly at a push-button to the side
of his desk.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>A lean,
bespectacled man with a foxlike face responded from the outer
office.&nbsp; &ldquo;You wanted me, Mr. Slack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jackson, send a man to the docks right
away,&rdquo; cried Slack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell him to look up a
fellow named Hammond who has a pass out on the tug and bring him
back here to me.&nbsp; Tell him to tell Hammond there&rsquo;s
been an oversight and I want to see him right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fox-faced man craned his neck at the south window of the
office.&nbsp; &ldquo;The tug&rsquo;s gone, Mr. Slack,&rdquo; he
announced.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a mile out in the lake
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereat Jackson discreetly withdrew while the Hon. J. J.
Slack, M.P., made the air sing with dark, unparliamentary
curses.</p>

44</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
&ldquo;A STOIC OF THE WOODS&mdash;A MAN WITHOUT A
TEAR&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Acey Smith returned to his
office after seeing Hammond to his sleeping quarters the night
the latter arrived at the Nannabijou Limits, he sat long by his
desk in strange cogitation, his eyes narrowed to brooding slits,
his mouth drawn over his even white teeth until it became a long
cruel hairline in a face that no longer masked its ruthless
craftiness.&nbsp; Acey Smith believed the faculties became most
acute after midnight.&nbsp; Most of the problems that arose in
the province of his activities were solved in the dead hours of
the night.&nbsp; And when a light burned late in Acey
Smith&rsquo;s office&mdash;well, there were sometimes orders to
execute that proved an unlovely surprise for one or more persons
of consequence on the morrow.</p>
<p>Of all the executives of the North Star Towing and Contracting
Company and its subsidiaries Acey Smith was the deepest enigma; a
man who lived for the most part to himself, kept no counsel with
his fellows.&nbsp; Of his antecedents there was little
known.&nbsp; He had risen from the obscurity of dear knows where
to the post of superintendent for the North Star Company; in fact
had been its chief out-of-doors executive since its inception as
a one-tug-and-barge salvaging and towing concern.&nbsp; He had
seen it rise to a position dominating the marine business of the
upper lakes and spread out commercial branches into the lumber
limits, the fur <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>territories, urban manufacturing and even the grain
belts of the prairie west.&nbsp; The North Star became the
mightiest commercial octopus of the North and the Northwest, but
Acey Smith never moved beyond the post of superintendent for the
parent company and general over-man of the subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Why this was so not even his brother executives of the North
Star enterprises could understand.&nbsp; That he &ldquo;held
cards&rdquo; with the executives of the company was current
belief.&nbsp; Some declared he was more in their confidence than
the president, Hon. J. J. Slack himself.&nbsp; Deeper ones sensed
some secret personal barrier that precluded his promotion.</p>
<p>In truth, there were times when Acey Smith cursed bitterly a
creature that had put a curse upon him through his
mother&mdash;startled her before he was born with a black curse
that stuck.</p>
<p>The Latin races in the cutting gangs steadfastly held Acey
Smith was in league with the Evil One, a superstition which
gained weight from a tale of old-timers of how he had once broken
a Finnish bully of the camps with his bare hands.&nbsp; Smith had
gone out to reprimand the Finn for causing a disturbance, whereat
the latter made use of a name that is a fighting-word wherever
men revere the honour of their parents.</p>
<p>The superintendent&rsquo;s form leaped out of his mackinaw
like the unsheathing of a rapier.&nbsp; The giant rushed him with
a roar; flailed at him with his great ape-like arms, intending
first to knock him to the ground and then stamp and lacerate him
with his caulked boots, after a refined custom of victors in
back-country encounters of those days.</p>
<p>Instead, the great Finn halted abruptly a few feet from Acey
Smith with a queer sound that was half sob, half moan.</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>The
Boss&rsquo;s arms had shot out like flickers of light to the
throat and face of the other, and what happened after that would
pale the story of the cruellest one-sided prizefight on
record.&nbsp; They carried the Finn away a bleeding, quivering
mass with a head that wabbled weirdly on a swollen, distorted
neck.</p>
<p>It was the Finn&rsquo;s last fight.&nbsp; Just what happened
he never told, and at mention of it he would jabber incoherent
things through teeth that chattered like those of one in the grip
of the ague.&nbsp; When he recovered sufficiently to get upon his
feet, he left camp at a limping run and was never seen in those
precincts again.</p>
<p>It was the look upon Acey Smith&rsquo;s face on that occasion
that left an indelible impress upon the memory of
witnesses&mdash;a light of incarnate fury and hate that sat there
while he pummelled the other into a pulp.&nbsp; None had ever
seen such a baneful gleam on the face of a man, and among those
hard-bitten, devil-may-care lumber-jacks there was none who
wished to ever look upon its like again.</p>
<p>What the witnesses to that fight had seen in Acey
Smith&rsquo;s face was a something that was always there, subdued
almost beyond detection in his normal moments, but ever leaping
in flickers to his features when powerful impulses were upon
him&mdash;an all-crushing, sinister thing that seemed to be
crying out from within him: &ldquo;Destroy!&nbsp; Destroy!&nbsp;
Destroy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was what Louis Hammond had seen, momentarily, when Acey
Smith had gripped his wrist at the door.&nbsp; It had brought
upon Hammond an unknown fear that it took all his strength of
will to hide.</p>
<p>But now, in the privacy of his midnight meditations,
conflicting emotions were mirrored in the countenance of the
master of the Nannabijou camps.&nbsp; As he sat pondering by his
desk the remnants of that evil light leaped <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>alternately
to his eyes only to dissipate in a softer glow that seemed to
signal the triumph of some better element of his nature.</p>
<p>Two problems assailed Acey Smith&mdash;one the hidden reason
for sending Louis Hammond to the limits and the other the
haunting eyes of a beautiful woman whose visit to his office
earlier in the evening had brought a magical surprise.</p>
<p>It was not that either of their visits was unexpected.&nbsp;
He had been apprised of their coming through the North
Star&rsquo;s own channels of information.&nbsp; &ldquo;As for
Hammond,&rdquo; he finally deduced, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s merely a
stool-pigeon&mdash;nothing more.&nbsp; But for what
purpose?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s what must be found out right
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He picked up Slack&rsquo;s letter of introduction.&nbsp; It
was a somewhat different epistle from what he had inferred it was
to Hammond:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear A.C.S.&mdash;The bearer, one Louis Hammond,
has evidently got something on the Big Quarry, who wants us to
keep him hidden on the limits at a good salary.&nbsp; It might be
a good idea to hang onto him and draw him out.&nbsp; What he
knows might be of value to us.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">J. J. <span
class="smcap">Slack</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acey Smith tore the letter into tiny shreds and dropped them
into the stove.&nbsp; &ldquo;Slack,&rdquo; he passed judgment,
&ldquo;has about as much real thinking matter above his eyebrows
as a yellow chipmunk.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Hammond and Slack were soon out of Acey Smith&rsquo;s
thoughts.&nbsp; He paced the floor in slow, thoughtful strides,
every now and then pausing to gaze at a certain point near the
door.&nbsp; An onlooker would have been amazed at the
metamorphosis that had come over the man.&nbsp; The harsh lines
had receded from his face and a something <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>came in their
place that in another might have been taken for the light of a
tender sentiment.</p>
<p>Memory of a gentle presence gripped him, gripped him with the
thrill of a golden song and an abandonment to its witchery that
was a back-cry from a youth this man of iron had never lived in
its fullness.</p>
<p>In his mental eye he could see her standing as she had stood
in his doorway, hesitant and waiting for him who was for the
moment held too spell-bound to speak.&nbsp; God, what eyes!&nbsp;
They had seemed to play into the very soul of him as shafts of
the morning sun golden and gladden the dourest recesses of the
wilderness hills.&nbsp; This was no toy of a girl, merely pretty
and pleasing to the eye.&nbsp; She was a beautiful woman in all
the wonderfully potential things that simple phrase conjures in
the fancy of a man who has seen the world and what tawdry stuff
lies behind much of its glint and glitter.&nbsp; He was totally
unprepared for such a discovery; he had never thought of things
turning out so.&nbsp; He had listened to her voice as one listens
to melody whose reminiscent notes carry him back into a nebula of
forgotten things, faint and elusive, yet hauntingly
familiar.&nbsp; Yet Acey Smith had never set eyes on this woman
before.</p>
<p>She had introduced herself as Miss Josephine Stone, of
Calgary, Alta., who had taken up temporary residence on Amethyst
Island, a picturesque reef formerly used as a summer resort and
situated about a mile and a half northwest of the docks of the
Nannabijou Limits.&nbsp; She had come there from the West,
accompanied by a woman companion, Mrs. Johnson, in compliance
with a letter she had received from Mr. J. C. Eckes, of the North
Star Towing and Contracting Company, who had intimated that
information of vital interest to her could only be communicated
to her sometime within the next few weeks, and, to accommodate
her and any companions and <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>servants she thought necessary to
bring with her, a cottage had been prepared for her occupancy on
Amethyst Island.&nbsp; A cheque, drawn on the North Star Company,
to cover her expenses, had been enclosed with the letter, which
enjoined her to the strictest secrecy, but she was directed to
call upon Mr. A. C. Smith, superintendent at the limits, at her
earliest convenience after she got settled on Amethyst
Island.&nbsp; Mr. Smith would see to her welfare till such time
as it was possible for her to be put in possession of the
information referred to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all so mysterious,&rdquo; she concluded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is more like something you would read about in a
book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is all very real, I assure you, Miss
Stone,&rdquo; replied Acey Smith.&nbsp; &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you be
seated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m afraid I cannot remain long.&nbsp; Mrs.
Johnson came over with me from the island and I left her waiting
in the motorboat at the dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You find things comfortable and congenial at the
island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very.&nbsp; I think it is such a delightful spot.&nbsp;
Just like a holiday for me, and I can get over and back to the
city so conveniently in the motorboat provided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not be averse to remaining there for say,
three to four weeks, if necessary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had not, evidently, been prepared
for such a request.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the meantime, am I to know
what this is all about, Mr. Smith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry I am not in a position to fully explain
to you what must seem like a very queer proceeding,&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;and I can only ask you to be content to await
developments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Eckes&mdash;when am I to meet him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;J.C.X.?&rdquo;&nbsp; Acey Smith pronounced it short and
in a cautious whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>&ldquo;That would be out of the question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I understood I was to meet him here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have misinterpreted the letter, Miss Stone.&nbsp;
Nowhere does it refer to such a meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl bit her nether lip.&nbsp; Her eyes flashed
dangerously.&nbsp; &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the answer,&rdquo; she
said coldly, &ldquo;we may as well end this farce at once.&nbsp;
I will return to Calgary to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Genuine alarm came into Acey Smith&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But, Miss Stone,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
know how much it is in your own interests that you stay&mdash;how
greatly you would jeopardise matters by leaving!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just it&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know!&nbsp; I feel
I have a right to know if I am to be asked to remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There could be no mistaking the determination in her voice and
manner.&nbsp; Plainly she was poignantly disappointed.&nbsp; The
superintendent gazed fixedly into space for a silent
period.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me time,&rdquo; he requested.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Give me time to find out what I may tell you.&nbsp; Will
you do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning, if you say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I call here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I will go to the island&mdash;with your
permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Smith.&nbsp; I will look for you at
10.30.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He accompanied her, hat in hand, to the door.&nbsp; She softly
declined his offer of escort to the dock, a declination that left
no hurt.&nbsp; She was a Western girl with a Western girl&rsquo;s
notions of independence in such matters.</p>
<p>Acey Smith had reluctantly applied himself to another pressing
matter with thoughts of her forcing themselves uppermost.&nbsp;
Then Hammond had come.&nbsp; Hammond&mdash;oh, well, he wanted to
forget Hammond and those other things for just now.</p>
<p>In spite of the predicament the girl&rsquo;s ultimatum had
apparently placed him in, Acey Smith had pleasure in <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>anticipating
the keeping of that appointment at Amethyst Island on the
following day.&nbsp; Before retiring he took from a wardrobe in
his private quarters a neatly pressed dark suit of tailor-made
clothes and laid it out in his room with fine shoes and
immaculate white linen.</p>
<p>Awakening the following morning he sat up in bed, and, gazing
at the city garments, laughed a harsh, soulless laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool,&rdquo; he syllabled grimly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fool&mdash;double-fool!&rdquo;&nbsp; He garbed himself in
his bush clothes and placed the fine raiment back in the
wardrobe.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>An hour later that morning, in the cook&rsquo;s quarters,
Louis Hammond came out of a dreamless sleep and for some moments
sat blinkingly trying to adjust himself to his new
surroundings.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t so sure now he was going to
like his new job or its environment.&nbsp; Used to an active
routine, he would many times rather have had some set schedule of
duties to perform than be left to find his own means of occupying
his time.&nbsp; There was something highly unsatisfactory about
the whole thing, and had it not been for the element of mystery
that challenged his patience, he would have felt like dropping
the assignment and leaving by the first tug for the city.</p>
<p>As if it were an echo of his thoughts, there came the shrill
tooting of the incoming morning tug down by the dock.&nbsp;
Hammond rolled out of his bunk and ran to the four-paned window
of the cabin.&nbsp; The tug had already been docked and snubbed
with the despatch characteristic of upper lakes sailormen.&nbsp;
The crew, hustling off supplies, paused while a single passenger,
a young woman wearing sable furs and a large picture hat,
landed.&nbsp; Something familiar about her caused Hammond to
watch <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>by
the window while she came leisurely up the camp road.</p>
<p>He started back with a suppressed exclamation as her features
became discernible.&nbsp; It was the face of the dark-eyed woman
he had seen get off the train at Moose Horn Station in the wake
of Norman T. Gildersleeve.</p>
<p>She turned and walked into the office of the superintendent
without rapping on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All our trails seem to lead to Acey Smith&rsquo;s
layout,&rdquo; grimly ruminated Hammond as he turned from the
window.</p>
<p>Breakfast, however, was uppermost in Hammond&rsquo;s mind at
the moment, and, hastily donning his clothes, he hurried over to
the dining camp just across the road from his sleeping
quarters.&nbsp; He expected a sharp reprimand for being late, but
he was met by a genial-faced, auburn-haired young man who
introduced himself as his shack-mate, Sandy Macdougal, head
cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s orders from the Big Boss you&rsquo;re to
feed when you like and sleep as long as you want,&rdquo; he said
smilingly as he indicated a place at one of the long plank tables
set out with accurately aligned rows of graniteware dishes and
great graniteware bowls of white sugar.</p>
<p>One of Macdougal&rsquo;s bull cooks brought in oatmeal
porridge, a platter heaped high with bacon and eggs, toast, a jug
of Snowshoe syrup and a big graniteware pot of steaming
coffee.&nbsp; Hammond had the diner to himself.&nbsp; He never
remembered an occasion in his life when he felt so hungry or a
meal appealed to him as so inviting.&nbsp; There is something in
the tang of the open-air North that puts a real edge on
one&rsquo;s appetite, and there are no workers so insistent about
the skill of the men who cook meals for them as lumber-jacks.</p>
<p>Macdougal returned from the kitchen a few moments later, and,
lighting a cigarette, sat down on the plank bench near Hammond
with back and elbows on the <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>table.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw your duds
when I tumbled out this morning,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;but I
suspected you were some friend of the boss&rsquo;s who&rsquo;d
come late in the night and I didn&rsquo;t wake you&mdash;Well,
for the love of Mike, look who&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond whirled.</p>
<p>At the door of the diner stood a weird figure.&nbsp; His face
was swarthy, almost black, with livid red scars on the
cheek-bones below each eye.&nbsp; Straight black hair, coarse as
a horse&rsquo;s mane, fell in glossy strands to his shoulders
from his uncovered head, where a single eagle&rsquo;s feather was
fastened at the back with a band of purple bound round the
temples and the brow.&nbsp; He wore a much-beaded, close-fitting
costume of brightly-coloured blanket-cloth, shoepack moccasins
and string upon string of glistening white wolves&rsquo; teeth
around his neck.</p>
<p>His was a face of deep sagacity, features aquiline and regular
as a white man&rsquo;s but possessing that solemn majesty of the
headmen of Northern tribes.&nbsp; It was made the more forbidding
by the self-inflicted wounds in the cheeks, and the whites of his
eyes showed garishly as he leisurely surveyed the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ogima Bush,&rdquo; he announced in a deep voice that
commanded respect in spite of his bizarre appearance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ogima Bush look to find Big Boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smith?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was Macdougal who spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Un-n-n-n</i>&mdash;Smid.&nbsp; Maybe you know where
me find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; informed Macdougal, throwing out his arms
expressively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gone away out on lake early.&nbsp;
Maybe not be back for long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian grunted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe you tell him Big Boss
Ogima Bush come to see him?&nbsp; Tell him big Medicine
Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; assented Macdougal.</p>
<p>The Indian turned and strode out, but not before he fixed
Hammond for one fleeting instant with an uncanny <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>flash from
his fierce black eyes, a glint in them that seemed to pierce the
young man through and through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some motion picture get-up that,&rdquo; Hammond
observed when the door closed behind him.&nbsp; &ldquo;An Indian
chief, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, worse than that,&rdquo; sniffed the cook.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s what they call a medicine man; even the whites
out here step out of the trail to let that bird pass.&nbsp;
Besides, one&rsquo;s got to be civil to them red-skinned
loafers,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;because the super. is in
some way cahoots with them and their pagan deviltry.&nbsp; Some
say he&rsquo;s really one of them only he happened to be born
white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond had to laugh over the other&rsquo;s rueful
seriousness.&nbsp; &ldquo;But is Smith really out?&rdquo; he
questioned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw a lady come off the tug this
morning and go into his office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty little devil with dark eyes and a flashy set
of furs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Yvonne,&rdquo; said Sandy the Cook.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, and maybe she wasn&rsquo;t rearin&rsquo; mad when she
found the Big Boss was out.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got to go back on
the tug this morning, and nobody here, not even Mooney, the
assistant super., knows where Smith&rsquo;s gone or when
he&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast finished, Hammond lit his pipe and strolled out
intending to look up the camp store and secure the bush clothing
Acey Smith had the night before advised him to rig out in.&nbsp;
At the door his attention was attracted to the dock by the
tooting of the tug now making ready to pull out.&nbsp; Two
figures stood in earnest conversation at the foot of the
tug&rsquo;s tiny gangway.&nbsp; The one was the girl in the sable
furs and picture hat and the other was a tall, black-bearded man
in a rusty black suit, the coat of which was over-long and square
cut at the bottom.</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>&ldquo;Now I wonder what Yvonne is chinnin&rsquo; to
that old goof about?&rdquo; speculated the cook at
Hammond&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s another
character that just bumped into camp a day or so ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like some sort of a preacher,&rdquo; hazarded
Hammond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he calls himself&mdash;Rev. Nathan
Stubbs,&rdquo; replied Sandy.&nbsp; &ldquo;He holds psalm-singing
sessions nights and Sundays, but he&rsquo;s never around camp
through the day when the Big Boss is here.&nbsp; The Big Boss
gave Mooney orders to keep him out of his sight because he always
made him feel like committin&rsquo; murder.&nbsp; Smith&rsquo;s
funny that way; some people he takes a violent dislike to right
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the tug&rsquo;s men plucked at the girl&rsquo;s sleeve
and motioned her to hurry up the gangway.&nbsp; The Rev. Nathan
Stubbs lifted his hat and shook hands with her when they
parted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny&mdash;damn funny.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
was perplexity in Macdougal&rsquo;s undertone observation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand Yvonne making up to the likes of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she <i>often</i> come out here?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Hammond asked it with an incautious inflection.&nbsp; He sensed
that when it was too late.</p>
<p>The other eyed him queerly, almost suspiciously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now maybe that isn&rsquo;t any of my business to be
gassin&rsquo; about,&rdquo; the cook declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
you don&rsquo;t look like a snoop, and I don&rsquo;t know
anything that&rsquo;s worth quizzin&rsquo; me for at that.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll advise you this much, mate: Don&rsquo;t be surprised
at anything you see or hear out here, and if you know
what&rsquo;s good for you you won&rsquo;t go pryin&rsquo; into
what you don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a queer layout
this, a mighty queer layout&mdash;and Acey Smith, the Big Boss,
is the queerest thing in it.&rdquo;</p>

56</span>CHAPTER V<br />
THE WAY OF A WOMAN</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Viewed</span> from the deck of a great
lakes steamer travelling the commercial lane that runs less than
two miles south of it, Amethyst Island is but a black speck among
a hundred other foam-rimmed islets that dot Superior&rsquo;s
rugged north shore, an infinitesimal bit of rock and dry land
before a frowning background of deep-riven hills, where range
upon range breasts out from Nannabijou Point and disappears into
the purple of the northern horizon.&nbsp; Time and evolution work
few changes on those hills of desolation which rear their black,
fantastic peaks above hostile, spruce-bearded flanks like
age-chained monsters scorning in lofty nudity the might of man to
efface or reclaim their barrenness.&nbsp; Everywhere they whisper
of dark potentialities; of secret places where awful stillness
reigns, of skulking grey wolves and gleaming white bones.</p>
<p>To the right of the clifflike point and seemingly rising just
back of the skirting woods opposite Amethyst Island is the Cup of
Nannabijou, a castlelike circle of black cliffs, whose base is
really a stiff walk from the shoreline.&nbsp; It is territory to
this day shunned by wandering Indian tribes, believed to be the
prison in which Nannabijou, the Indian demi-god, attempted to
wall up Animikee, the Thunder Devil; and this belief is
strengthened in poor Lo&rsquo;s mind by the magnetic flashes
which play up from the hills on nights preceding electrical
storms.&nbsp; <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>Along a depression at the base of the cliffs flows
Solomon Creek on its way to join the mighty, amber-coloured
Nannabijou River before the latter empties into the bay.&nbsp;
Solomon Creek tumbles out in a foaming white cascade from a great
fissure in the cliffs, being the outlet for a limpid mountain
lake confined by the walls of the Cup, a gleaming pool of gold by
day and a mystic black mirror of the stars by night.&nbsp; In the
rocks the Indians see the images of the men and beasts of their
pagan worship; from a distance out on the lake the whole
resembles the form of a recumbent giant lying on his back on the
face of the waters.</p>
<p>But Amethyst Island itself, on closer inspection, proves of
happier mien than its forbidding surroundings and of dimensions
somewhat more significant than one would guess from the steamboat
routes.&nbsp; Its area would equal half a city block and its
shoreline is groved by patches of picturesque birch gleaming
white among the mountain ash and spruce, while here and there a
lofty, isolated white pine rears its whispering crest above the
lower foliage with an air of patriarchal guardianship.&nbsp; A
half dozen log cabins of substantial size and dove-tailed
construction stand in the cleared centre, relics of a bygone
silver mining boom, later renovated by wealthy city families into
summer resort cottages.</p>
<p>In the most easterly of these cottages, Josephine Stone, of
Calgary, had taken up her temporary residence.&nbsp; On this
particular morning, which had broken in crisp autumnal
loveliness, she had been astir from an early hour, and with her
Indian maid and her companion, Mrs. Johnson, had set in order the
appointments of the little front room with exacting care.&nbsp;
No detail had been overlooked to make the best of such
furnishings as the building boasted; even the blinds Miss Stone
had herself accurately adjusted so that the softest light
illumined the <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>room.&nbsp; In the broad fireplace, built of native
amethyst-encrusted boulders, a birch fire crackled in subdued
cheeriness.&nbsp; On the table which centred the room stood a
vase of fresh-gathered ferns, a bit of dull green colour that
toned with the dignified quiet all about.</p>
<p>But Josephine Stone needed no artificial setting.&nbsp; A
dream of fresh young womanly loveliness she was; a gentle
presence that would brighten and glorify the most monotonous
surroundings.&nbsp; Men wherever she had appeared had been swayed
by this girl&rsquo;s rare beauty, by the charm of her voice and
her every gesture.</p>
<p>She had long since learned her power over men; this morning
she was minded to test it impelled as she was by that resistless
motive that has been called a woman&rsquo;s curiosity&mdash;the
motive that first brought mortal man to grief.</p>
<p>She moved about the room as one who is suppressing by will the
tensest inward anxiety.&nbsp; Her Indian woman dismissed, she had
tried to interest herself in a book, but her gaze most of the
time was centred through the eastern window on a jutting point of
the lake&rsquo;s shoreline.</p>
<p>Josephine Stone dropped the book and caught at her
breath.&nbsp; Round the point there suddenly flashed the slender
red hull of a racing motor boat, bow reared in air above a creamy
wavelet that widened V-like in its wake.&nbsp; The boat swept
down the shoreline and the muffled staccato of its engines ceased
abruptly as it dived from view under the shrubbery that fringed
the island.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The girl watched with bated breath.&nbsp; From an opening in
the shrubbery there almost immediately burst into view the figure
of a man who seemed the incarnation of this wild place.&nbsp;
Spare was he, but of height, build and <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>movement that bespoke physical
strength of lightninglike potentialities.&nbsp; The exotic pallor
of his masterful face accentuated the blackness of his alert,
flashing eyes.</p>
<p>The Indian man-of-all-work, splitting firewood to the side of
the cottage, looked up, gasped and scuttled from view.&nbsp; His
wolf-dog sank back on his haunches, tilted his grey snout in air
and sent forth a long, dolorous howl that brought mocking echoes
from the cliffs of the mainland.</p>
<p>The visitor, quite unconcerned by the seeming panic his
appearance provoked, strode easily to the front door.</p>
<p>Josephine Stone rose all a-tremble.&nbsp; A fear unaccountable
had suddenly swept over her, but when she opened the door for him
there was no longer outward trace of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Smith,&rdquo; she voiced, &ldquo;I know I have
put you to a lot of trouble to come over here this morning.&nbsp;
It is really too good of you simply to accommodate a
stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not have you mention it, Miss Stone,&rdquo; he
waived with a courtly smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is I rather who
should offer apologies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m late.&nbsp; Delayed by the discovery of a
defective boom on my way here.&nbsp; Had to go back and notify
one of the boom-tenders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heavy responsibilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the faintest of inflections on the last word.&nbsp;
It brought a momentary gleam of hard alertness to the face of
Acey Smith.&nbsp; But he as quickly hid it in a light
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;It all came about through my weakness for
travelling by water,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see,
there is a shorter cut by the land trail here, though I would
have had to signal for one of your boats to get over to the
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you be seated?&rdquo;&nbsp; She indicated
the easy chair <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>by the window and herself sank gracefully to the nearby
couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smith,&rdquo; she opened in a nervous confusion
that brought the faintest of pink to her delicate throat and
cheeks, &ldquo;I fear I am asking of you too great a
favour&mdash;that I am about to request too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had not asked me to come here and offer what
little service I may,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I would consider
I had been robbed of one of the most wonderful opportunities of
my lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have you considered the full nature of my
request?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spell of those wonder eyes under the high-arched brows was
upon him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Name it,&rdquo; he urged.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
must obey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not compromise yourself before you know it
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already compromised myself.&nbsp; I have
promised to do anything within my power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stirred on the couch, came ever so little nearer to
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have feared my request might be an impossible
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An impossible one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yet&mdash;I had hoped almost that you
might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he encouraged.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me what
it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to meet the <i>man you call
J.C.X.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had she plunged ice-cold water upon him the effect on Acey
Smith could not have been more startling.&nbsp; His face went
ashen at the name, his long hands gripping convulsively at the
arms of the chair.&nbsp; He glanced apprehensively about the
room, even behind him, then sprang bolt upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>J.C.X.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; He breathed it
hoarsely.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are no others within
hearing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul.&rdquo; It was she who was calmer now.&nbsp;
She <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>too
had risen, was standing with a thrilling nearness to him, so
close as to be within the province of his arms had he obeyed an
almost irresistible impulse that was upon him to sweep her to
him.&nbsp; She looked up at him, a steadiness in the appeal of
her eyes.</p>
<p>Under the sway of those eyes decision within him
wavered.&nbsp; When he spoke it was in a tone of solemn
pronouncement: &ldquo;Miss Stone, you <i>have</i> asked of me
what <i>should be</i> impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>you</i> can make it a possibility?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ultimate decision lies
with&mdash;J.C.X.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again that furtive glance about
the room as he pronounced the name in a whispered
undertone.&nbsp; &ldquo;It were better&mdash;perhaps&mdash;that
you should not meet J.C.X.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he so terrible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is not that.&nbsp; If I could in some way act as
intermediary, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the girl was in no wise willing to let slip by her
hard-won concession.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would not do,&rdquo; she
negatived.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sorry, for I know I could trust you
as such, but I feel it is imperative that I should meet J.C.X.
personally if that which I was sent for is to be properly
explained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes searched her face.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you know of
J.C.X.?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;positively nothing.&nbsp; Oh, I wish I
could explain.&nbsp; I hate being mysterious, but for the present
I must ask you to accept my statement that it appeals to me as
vital to meet him.&nbsp; Can you accept such a
statement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under stress of her anxiety she had unconsciously placed an
ivory-white little hand upon his sleeve.&nbsp; He thrilled at the
pressure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can and do accept it,&rdquo; he returned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is more, when the time is opportune, you shall meet
the one you <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>desire to.&nbsp; But you must be patient; for a little
while there will be obstacles which are
insurmountable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how can I thank you, Mr. Smith?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Impulsively she seized his hand in both her own, artlessly as a
child might do it.</p>
<p>Not even saint might have resisted that delicate, desirable
presence so near.&nbsp; Acey Smith was far from saint.&nbsp; His
long, powerful hands closed over hers, a devil of gleaming black
triumph leaping to the eyes that feasted on her face.</p>
<p>But even as she drew away, trembling like a captured bird, he
released her abruptly.&nbsp; His head shot forward and he whirled
with his back toward her, his hands cupping at his face in the
convulsive fashion of one who is strangling.</p>
<p>She was standing mute in stupefied fright when he faced her
again, quite his former self, a trace of a shamed smile on his
lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he offered in a contrite
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was perhaps my fault&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She started
to say that before its significance struck her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not!&rdquo; he declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had
forgotten for the moment that&mdash;that I am merely a means to
an end.&nbsp; It will not happen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did her best to hide her mystification.&nbsp; Before
he left Acey Smith informed her the tugs plying daily between the
pulp camp and the city were at her service.&nbsp; He had made
arrangements not only for her passage back and forth, but for the
carrying of such supplies out as she needed from time to
time.&nbsp; This would be much more satisfactory than depending
on the motor-boat, he told her, as from now on the weather on the
northern reaches of Superior was not dependable.</p>
<p>As for the unexplained purpose for which she had been brought
to the island, he hoped she would be <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>tolerant of a delay in bringing
things about that would not only take time but patience and
foresight on the part of others.&nbsp; He did not mention J.C.X.
again nor the meeting he had promised to arrange for Miss
Stone.&nbsp; But intuitively the latter knew two things; the one
was that he would be as good as his word and the other that he
almost dreaded mention of J.C.X.</p>
<p>Besides, Josephine Stone was but two generations removed from
Canadian pioneer stock, and, like the women of her race, was not
prone to question the moods and whimsicalities of men of the
forests.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>When Acey Smith left Amethyst Island he did not immediately
head back for the pulp camp, but crossed over to the mainland
opposite, where he beached the bow of his long, slender racer at
the foot of a narrow trail that wound up into the densely wooded
hills.&nbsp; Snubbing the boat to the shrubbery, he struck off up
the trail and was gone for almost an hour.</p>
<p>Shortly after his form had been swallowed up in the bush,
there appeared at the foot of the trail a tall, dark-bearded man
in the garb of a preacher.&nbsp; He peered at the island from the
screen of the bush, and there, concealed from view, squatted in
the foliage with eyes upon the cottage, silent, immovable as a
statue.</p>
<p>Josephine Stone came out upon the cottage steps and opened a
book in her lap.&nbsp; If the figure in the woods noticed her he
gave no sign.</p>
<p>After a long interval there came from out of the depths of the
forest, far away, a low reverberating intonation as of some deep
soft gong being struck.&nbsp; A few moments elapsed and the
mellow note again swooned mystically over the wastes.</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>The
faintest traces of a smile broke over the face of the man hidden
in the bushes as the girl on the steps started to her feet and
looked about her in bewilderment.&nbsp; She picked up her book
and disappeared into the cottage.</p>
<p>Twice again with a short interval between there came a
gonglike alarm from far up in the silent wastes.&nbsp; The
black-bearded man rose at the sound of the last stroke of the
gong.&nbsp; With patient caution he drew from the shrubbery a
cached canoe, launched it and with silent strokes skimmed
westward along the shoreline.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later Acey Smith came striding down the trail,
carrying on his back a partially filled woodsman&rsquo;s
packsack.&nbsp; At the foot of the trail he paused as though
reading some sign in the sands of the beach.&nbsp; He swung the
packsack from his shoulders into the cockpit of the boat, pushed
off the craft and headed it toward the pulp camp docks.</p>
<p>There was a scowl on his face as black as a thunder cloud.</p>

65</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
A MILLIONAIRE VANISHES</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the days went by Louis Hammond
familiarised himself with the pulp camp and its environs.&nbsp;
He had plenty of time on his hands, for, as Acey Smith had
predicted, there was little else for him to do except &ldquo;take
in the scenery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gained a liberal education in the garnering of the raw
product for the paper-making industry.&nbsp; The Nannabijou
Limits, he learned, comprised an enormous block of wilderness
territory some ninety square miles in extent, most of which,
outside of the great muskegs and mountain lakes, was covered with
forests of spruce, balsam and birch, representing billions of
money when transformed into the white paper on which many of the
great and lesser newspapers and magazines of the United States as
well as Canada would be printed.</p>
<p>The limits stretched east down the North Shore from the foot
of the Nannabijou range far beyond a point of vision and extended
due north inland a good fifty or sixty miles.&nbsp; They were
bisected by the mighty Nannabijou River, which emptied into the
bay at the western fringe of the camp between deep, precipitous
banks.&nbsp; It was this stream that made the Nannabijou Limits
so desirable, because it made transportation of the cut poles by
water possible from the furthest inland reaches of the
territory.&nbsp; Armies of men were engaged in cutting,
buck-sawing and decking poles into the river, there being camp
after camp, some of them larger than that at the <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>waterfront,
for a good twenty miles up the stream.&nbsp; Men and teams were
constantly employed hauling supplies back to them.&nbsp; Yet it
was said that this season&rsquo;s cut would scarcely make a
scratch on the gigantic Nannabijou forests.</p>
<p>From the mouth of the Nannabijou the cut and barked poles
poured into the bay in a wide, glistening white ribbon day and
night, continually expanding the tremendous booms, where Hammond
was told there was already nearly a million dollars&rsquo; worth
of pulpwood.&nbsp; Later on, power-driven mechanical loaders on
scows would transfer the poles from the booms to the holds of
huge pulp-pole carriers, and in these they would be towed by tugs
to the mill yards in Kam City.</p>
<p>A large portion of the wood must be delivered that very fall
so that the Kam City Pulp and Paper Company could have their
mills in operation on contract time in October.&nbsp; Otherwise,
the latter company would forfeit their hard-won rights on the
limits; and by the terms of the final fiat of the Ontario
government the North Star Towing and Contracting Company, at
present operating the limits, were bound to deliver the wood in
sufficient quantities to keep the Kam City Company&rsquo;s mills
running all winter.</p>
<p>It was a stupendous undertaking&mdash;the most colossal in the
history of paper-making.&nbsp; And woven into this was the
intense rivalry of the two powerful paper companies concerned, a
tension of bitter hatred that was the more ominous because
surface indications told nothing of what the inevitable climax
might be.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Hammond gained much of his information about the limits from
his shack-mate, Sandy Macdougal, the cook, <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>who in the
evening over a bottle of rye whiskey became quite
loquacious.&nbsp; It was through Macdougal he learned of the
presence of the girl with the high-arched eyebrows on Amethyst
Island, a bit of information that brought about a secret
determination to somehow or other come in contact with her, much
as the mere idea of again meeting her face to face perturbed
him.</p>
<p>Of Acey Smith he saw little, caught only occasional glimpses
of him now and then as he went in and out of his office.&nbsp; No
one seemed to know where he kept himself a large part of the
time.&nbsp; Actual operation of the camps and dealings with the
men were carried on almost entirely by the assistant
superintendent, a rawboned, hatchet-faced young man named Mooney,
who was as uncommunicative as a slab of trap rock.</p>
<p>Ogima Bush, the Indian medicine man, seemed to have the
freedom of the camp, to which he paid frequent visits, mixing
with the workers of his own race of whom there were several
hundred employed in breaking up jams in the river and tending the
booms in the bay.&nbsp; They were what was known as the
&ldquo;white water&rdquo; men because of their hazardous work in
the foaming rapids.</p>
<p>Rev. Nathan Stubbs, the camp preacher, journeyed back and
forth from one camp to the other.&nbsp; He did not sleep in any
of the camps but repaired each night to some isolated shack he
had fixed up for himself somewhere in the fastnesses of
Nannabijou Mountain.&nbsp; He seemed to purposely avoid Hammond,
as he did most of the executives of the limits, and a feature
that struck the young man as rather odd was that he never saw
Ogima Bush or the Rev. Nathan Stubbs and Acey Smith together or
even in the camp at the one time, though the Medicine Man
frequently inquired as to the superintendent&rsquo;s whereabouts
and on such occasions immediately struck off as though he had an
appointment with him <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>some-where.&nbsp; It was plain that
Acey Smith looked upon the preacher as a pest and insisted on him
making himself scarce when he was about camp; as for the Medicine
Man, there seemed to be some understanding between him and the
superintendent whereby the former was quite confident of his
status and privileges anywhere on the limits.</p>
<p>There was something queer&mdash;so queer as to be absolutely
uncanny&mdash;about this gigantic pulp camp.&nbsp; Hammond could
see that every intelligent worker in it sensed this, but nobody
understood it or could tangibly grasp a glimmer of what it
was.&nbsp; The morale among the cutting gangs, teamsters and boom
workers could scarcely be improved upon.&nbsp; Men who shirked
their work lost the regard of their fellows and either soon
learned to put their best into their efforts or left camp.&nbsp;
The North Star Company held the reputation of paying and feeding
their employ&eacute;s better than any other outfit in the north
country.&nbsp; There were camp hospitals with camp doctors and
competent men nurses; it was even said that no man was docked for
lost time while he was really sick.&nbsp; Incidentally, there
were no evidences of iron discipline or slave-driving
methods.&nbsp; But everywhere among the men and their petty
executives there was an undercurrent of something akin to
superstitious awe of the company and those who directed its
affairs.</p>
<p>Acey Smith himself seemed to be obsessed with this same
haunting apprehension.&nbsp; When he issued orders he did so more
like one who is interpreting definite commands from
elsewhere.&nbsp; As Sandy Macdougal analysed it to Hammond after
his own peculiar fashion, &ldquo;one felt as though the whole
show was being run by <i>some one or something that didn&rsquo;t
cast a shadow</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>III</h3>
<p>His enforced idleness brought a notion to the young
ex-newspaper man that he could improve his time by writing, even
if it were only a diary of his experiences.&nbsp; He felt he must
have something to occupy his time besides roaming over the tote
roads and riding around in the fussy little gasoline tugs of the
boom-tenders, so, early one morning he presented himself at Acey
Smith&rsquo;s office and boldly asked if he might have some loose
writing paper.&nbsp; Acey Smith quite readily complied with his
wishes, going to the rear of his office and bringing to Hammond
several pads of blank sheets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had been expecting you to come around for
this,&rdquo; he said, the ghost of an exultant flicker playing at
the corners of his mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;The ruling hobby will
force itself to the surface sooner or later, won&rsquo;t it, Mr.
Hammond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning just what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this: Set a man at doing nothing long enough and
habit will drive him back to the haunts of his old
rut&mdash;especially if that rut is writing for
publication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond illy-suppressed a start at this broad hint at
knowledge of his identity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no designs for
writing anything for publication, if that&rsquo;s what
you&rsquo;re driving at,&rdquo; he, however, came back
frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not the remotest notion that you will,&rdquo;
Acey Smith assured him with a tinge of sarcasm in his
tones.&nbsp; &ldquo;In fact, I am quite confident that for the
present you won&rsquo;t reach a publisher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared strangely at Hammond for a silent second, his black
eyes glazing in a weird fixidity.&nbsp; Hammond was conscious
Acey Smith was speaking now more as one trying to interpret a
whim of the back mind: &ldquo;Now, if I were a novelist, which I
am not, and in the mood, likewise absent, I might make myself the
author of the <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>queerest tale ever written.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pity the
world gets most of its literature second-hand and consequently
garbled; the man who lives things doesn&rsquo;t write, and the
man who writes never seems able to live the things he writes
about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real writers then must be men born twice who never
touched pen to paper till their second existence, don&rsquo;t you
think so, Mr. Hammond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never considered it from that angle,&rdquo;
replied the younger man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you for the paper,
Mr. Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it over,&rdquo; urged Acey Smith enigmatically as
he whirled on a heel and returned to his desk.</p>
<p>Hammond went away inwardly as chagrined as a disguised man who
has had his wig and false beard suddenly whisked from his head
and face.&nbsp; His attempt to conceal his identity from Acey
Smith surely had been a ridiculous farce.&nbsp; Perhaps the pulp
camp superintendent knew more than he did himself about what
purpose lay behind his being sent to the limits.</p>
<p>The situation was a humiliating one, Hammond bitterly conceded
as he sat alone in the cabin he shared with the cook.&nbsp; It
would be bad enough to be found out and know what one was found
out for, but it was infinitely more exasperating to feel that he
was a marked man without knowing the exact nature of the
predicament he had allowed himself to be dropped into.&nbsp; Acey
Smith had a manner of making Hammond feel like a mere outsider
every time they came in contact, and the latter, completely in
the dark as to the objects of his own mission, was as impotent to
meet and parry the other&rsquo;s stinging thrusts as a man who
fences with a blindfold on.&nbsp; Smith did not exactly despise
him; he had reason to believe that.&nbsp; It was Smith&rsquo;s
lightly-concealed exultation over knowledge of his helplessness
that galled him so.</p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Hammond
longed to meet the other on fair ground&mdash;in a battle of wits
or fists, he was not particular which, so long as he could exact
satisfaction for his hurt pride.&nbsp; But this fighting in the
dark was a hopeless business, and he was becoming weary of
it.</p>
<p>Yet&mdash;what did Smith know?&nbsp; What <i>did</i> he
know?</p>
<p>With this conjecture came an inspiration that brought Hammond
a newer and a brighter viewpoint.&nbsp; When he more calmly
mulled the situation over in the seclusion of his quarters, it
struck him Acey Smith was merely guessing.&nbsp; He had not
definitely referred to him as an ex-newspaper man, but had merely
insinuated he knew him to be a writer.&nbsp; This was a thing one
so shrewd of observation as the pulp camp master might easily
surmise when Hammond asked for writing paper.&nbsp; That
subsequent drifting of his onto the status of fiction writers was
a cast for information, his reference to the genius of writing
men an obvious attempt at flattery&mdash;and the hook was baited
with a hint that he himself had a life-story that would be worth
while getting hold of.</p>
<p>The whole thing seemed so clear now that Hammond accused
himself of stupidity in not seeing through it before.&nbsp;
Hammond&rsquo;s plan therefore would be to follow the plane of
the least resistance and let Smith go on thinking what he
pleased.&nbsp; Even better still, why not approach Smith for that
&ldquo;queerest tale&rdquo; he had referred to and make a play to
his vanity?&nbsp; No doubt egotism was Acey Smith&rsquo;s most
vulnerable point and the <i>open sesame</i> to his confidence, as
Hammond in his journalistic experience had found it to be with
most despotic executives, high or low.</p>
<p>But no, that would not do.&nbsp; There was one thing in the
way still.&nbsp; If he only knew what he was here for he could
act.&nbsp; As things stood, he feared to take the initiative lest
he blunder into something that would upset the plan Norman T.
Gildersleeve had in mind that night on <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>the train when he had engaged Hammond
at a thousand dollars a month to stay at the pulp camp till he
received further orders.&nbsp; No matter how he theorised and
tried to prop it up with possible purposes, it appealed more and
more to him as a crazy assignment.&nbsp; Bagsful of mail was
brought over daily on the tugs, and, so far as Hammond could see,
the mail was delivered direct and with considerable despatch all
over the camps.&nbsp; It should therefore be an easy matter for
Gildersleeve to write him, if it were only a few lines, to let
him know whether or not things were progressing as they
should.&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t Gildersleeve communicate with
him?</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>The plump figure and ruddy visage of Sandy Macdougal appeared
momentarily at the cabin doorway and he flung a bundle of
newspapers across at Hammond.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Big Boss left them
at the breakfast table this morning and said you might like to
see them,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s
beat it for somewhere for the day, for I saw him leave with his
pack on his back just a minute or two after you left his
office.&nbsp; Come over to the beanery for a chat when
you&rsquo;re through reading up the news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The head cook turned and departed for his realm of bake ovens
and enamelled pots and pans.</p>
<p>That was Acey Smith&rsquo;s humiliating system all over again,
ruminated Hammond.&nbsp; Smith had eaten that very morning just
two seats away from Hammond with the newspapers spread on the
table before him.&nbsp; When he had finished breakfast, he folded
them up and sat smoking until Hammond left the diner.&nbsp; Why
did he wait till Hammond went out and then tell the cook to give
him the papers?&nbsp; It was a by-word around the camps that Acey
Smith never did anything out of the ordinary <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>without a
definite object in view.&nbsp; He was evidently baiting Hammond
for a purpose.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hammond gathered up the newspapers
gratefully.&nbsp; They were the first of recent date he had seen
since coming to the pulp camp.&nbsp; The light in the cabin was
none too bright, so Hammond took the papers outside and seated
himself on a rustic bench back of the cabin.</p>
<p>The outer paper in the bundle was the Kam City <i>Star</i> of
the previous morning, but Hammond, his eyes starting from their
sockets, scarcely noted the dateline in the shock that went home
from the three-column heading that fairly shouted at him in
black-faced gothic from the upper left-hand corner of the front
page:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>MAN RESEMBLING NORMAN T.
GILDERSLEEVE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>REPORTED SEEN NEAR PRINCE
ALBERT, SASK.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>MAY BE MISSING PULP AND PAPER
MAGNATE</b></p>
<p>In fevered haste, Hammond skipped over the subheadings to the
despatch below them date-lined from Prince Albert, Saskatchewan,
with date of the day previous:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>To-day, lumbermen coming in from the woods north
of here told of the arrival in the McKenzie camps of a
middle-aged stranger strongly resembling the descriptions sent
broadcast of the missing Norman T. Gildersleeve, of New York,
head of the International Investments Corporation, whose
disappearance from a transcontinental train bound east from
Winnipeg, on the night of September 23, caused a sensation in
financial circles in Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>Strength is lent the theory that the man is Norman T.
Gildersleeve by the statement of the lumbermen that the stranger
seemed to be afflicted with loss of memory.&nbsp; He told the
superintendent of the camps that he had seemed to come out of a
state of trance after leaving a train at the terminus of the bush
railway and had no idea who he was or where he came from.&nbsp;
He put up for the night at the lumber camp, but the next <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>morning
disappeared as mysteriously as he had arrived.</p>
<p>Mr. Gildersleeve, it will be remembered, first dropped out of
sight while on a train bound from Winnipeg, Man., to Kam City,
Ont.&nbsp; His intended visit to the latter place, it is
understood, was in connection with the construction of the Kam
City Pulp and Paper Mills plant, a Canadian subsidiary of the
International Investments Corporation, now being erected at the
lakeport town.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Gildersleeve&rsquo;s disappearance the police of the
Dominion have been vainly scouring the country for trace of
him.&nbsp; The news from the McKenzie Camps to-day will no doubt
provide a fresh trail, though how Mr. Gildersleeve could travel
back west almost a thousand miles without being identified by
some one, particularly trainmen, is beyond the comprehension of
authorities here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There followed a grist of newspaper theories in which Hammond
was not particularly interested.&nbsp; He scanned thoroughly the
newspaper and two others in the bundle, but found no other items
throwing further light on the mystery.&nbsp; An editorial in the
edition he had first read caught his eye.&nbsp; It dealt with the
odd circumstances of Norman T. Gildersleeve&rsquo;s disappearance
and was headed:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">APHASIA, OR LOSS OF IDENTITY</p>
<p>Aphasia&mdash;aphasia&mdash;where had Hammond recently heard
or read that word?&nbsp; Then with an electric start he
remembered that disconcerting first question Acey Smith had flung
at him the night he arrived at the pulp camp: &ldquo;<i>What do
you know about aphasia</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A coincidence it must have been, he reflected on calmer
deduction.&nbsp; Acey Smith, out here at the pulp limits, twenty
miles from the nearest outpost of civilisation, could then have
no knowledge of Gildersleeve&rsquo;s disappearance several
hundred miles west of the port of Kam City.</p>
<p>And yet&mdash;yet the Girl with the High-Arched <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Eye-brows had
just been in to see Smith previous to Hammond&rsquo;s
visit.&nbsp; She had been in the same coach of the
transcontinental when Gildersleeve had left the train at Moose
Horn Station and failed to return&mdash;and her nervous
perturbation on two occasions when she had caught sight of
Hammond had been marked.</p>
<p>Great heavens, it could not be that she&mdash;this beautiful
creature he had dreamed about, whose wondrous blue eyes haunted
his waking hours&mdash;that she knew and had carried the news to
Acey Smith!&nbsp; Hammond tried to banish the thought as a low,
unfounded suspicion.&nbsp; It was merely a sinister muddle of
events, he told himself, into which she, more so than himself,
had been innocently drawn.&nbsp; That was it&mdash;certainly that
was it.</p>
<p>He leaped to his feet and turned at a raucous, croaking sound
behind him.</p>
<p>A hoarse, half-angry, half-startled exclamation came through
his teeth as his gaze fell upon the gloomy, spectrelike figure of
Ogima Bush the Medicine Man standing between two birch trees
directly behind his seat.&nbsp; The Indian was as immovable, as
untouched in face by any human emotion as if he had always stood
there a carved figure in wood.&nbsp; The scars on his cheek-bones
gleamed in fresh and horrid scarlet lividity, and his eyes with
their garish white setting glowed like embers of hate in a
gargoyle of unspeakable wickedness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; demanded Hammond sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Un-n-n-n ugh</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Medicine
Man&rsquo;s eyes centred on Hammond much as they might have had
he been a passing wesse-ke-jak while he gutturalled it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ogima Bush takes what he wants.&nbsp; <i>Kaw-gaygo
esca-boba</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned leisurely, chuckling queerly in his throat as he
uttered the question in Objibiwa.</p>
<p>Then he strode off into the bush quite unconcerned as to what
answer Hammond might make.</p>
<h2><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

THE HILL OF LURKING DEATH</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Old</span> Leather Face seems to be
peeved about it, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Sandy Macdougal who spoke.&nbsp; He had returned from
the cook-house unnoticed by Hammond and had evidently been an
amused spectator while the dialogue was going on between Hammond
and Ogima Bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get what he croaked at you, Hammond?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I caught something about him &lsquo;taking what he
wanted&rsquo; or words to that effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said: &lsquo;Ogima takes what he wants,&rsquo; and
then he asked, &lsquo;<i>Kaw-gaygo esca-boba</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s Indian for &lsquo;Have you got nothing?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Sounds foolish, but when an Indian asks it the way he
did&mdash;that way, look out!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s either looking for
whiskey or trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s rapping at the door of the
goat&rsquo;s house for wool this time,&rdquo; laughed
Hammond.&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen anything that looked
like good whiskey in a blue moon, and, as for trouble, I can
usually locate plenty of it without seeking it from a
red-skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speakin&rsquo; of whiskey,&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s eyes
crinkled, &ldquo;how&rsquo;d you like a little nip right
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; sort of all
bowled over about something, and a little snort will brace you
up.&nbsp; Come on in the shack.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Inside
the cabin Macdougal closed the door and hooked it on the
inside.&nbsp; He lifted some loose flooring in the corner and
brought up a black bottle.&nbsp; &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be
afraid of it,&rdquo; he assured Hammond as he poured him a
draught in a metal cup.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is sealed rye goods I
got on a doctor&rsquo;s prescription.&nbsp; But I got to keep it
dark because there&rsquo;s two things the Big Boss is death on
any of us totin&rsquo; around camp; the one is six-guns and the
other is whiskey. . . .&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s how!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macdougal guzzled a generous cupful straight.&nbsp; Hammond
perforce had to take his neat too.</p>
<p>The cook made to fill the two cups again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; declined Hammond.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t indulge as a general thing, but I&rsquo;ll admit
that&rsquo;s fairly smooth stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy tossed off another stiff one.&nbsp; Then he sat down
smacking his lips as though it agreed with him immensely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You never met that copper-faced old rat before you came
out here?&rdquo; he asked presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;Ogima Bush?&nbsp; No, I never before set eyes
on him until that morning he wandered in while I was at
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;well!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Macdougal studied his cup reflectively one minute.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You know, I thought at first maybe you and him might be
cahoots on something.&nbsp; One don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s who
out in this queer dump.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve sized you up as a
decent head, no matter what your business might be, and you
takin&rsquo; a nip with me now and then has raised you a bit more
in my notions of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens,&rdquo; smiled Hammond, &ldquo;you surely
didn&rsquo;t think I was in league with that near-agent of
Satan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; I was sure of
anything,&rdquo; cut back Macdougal slightly irritated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Only, I had one of my flash hunches that first morning he
dropped into the diner that there was something between him and
you.&nbsp; It was the <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>way he looked at you, I guess.&nbsp;
Since then, I&rsquo;ve been figurin&rsquo; out it&rsquo;s all on
his side and maybe you don&rsquo;t know anything about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; he followed up deliberately,
&ldquo;what I been debatin&rsquo; in my own mind the past day or
so was about tellin&rsquo; you something for your own
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macdougal appeared to be in the throes of that mental debate
as he sat with eyes glued on his empty cup.&nbsp; He seemed to
arrive at two decisions suddenly.&nbsp; The first was to have
another tidy drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great hootch that.&rdquo;&nbsp; He grimaced
gratefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, look here, Hammond, it&rsquo;s
this: That old, red-skinned side-wheeler don&rsquo;t mean you no
good, and, if you&rsquo;ll take it from me, I think he&rsquo;s
figurin&rsquo; on how much of a boost it&rsquo;d take to shoot
you over one of them steep cliffs back in the bush if you
happened to be near the edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now wait&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t given to guessin&rsquo;
nor romancin&rsquo; either.&nbsp; I got a sharp eye that sees
more&rsquo;n most people gives it credit for.&nbsp; Every time
you ain&rsquo;t lookin&rsquo; that Indian is a-watchin&rsquo; you
out of the corners of his wicked old lids in a queer, creepy way,
just like a weasel watches a chipmunk he&rsquo;s figurin&rsquo;
on for breakfast.&nbsp; Besides, sometimes you go out in the bush
and he slips out a little later in the same direction.&nbsp; At
first I tells myself: &lsquo;The two of them has a date on to
meet out there on some scheme they&rsquo;re hatchin&rsquo;
up&mdash;maybe bootleggin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I hunched it
later there was nothin&rsquo; to that.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
layin&rsquo; for you for some reason I don&rsquo;t know anything
about; that&rsquo;s what I wanted to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Hammond lit a cigarette to cover up any concern he might have
felt.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s certainly interesting to me,
Sandy,&rdquo; he acknowledged, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s deucedly
good of you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; of the kind!&rdquo; interposed the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that ain&rsquo;t all.&nbsp; <i>Acey
Smith&rsquo;s got another Indian trailin&rsquo;
you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trailing me?&nbsp; The deuce you say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what makes you think Acey Smith&rsquo;s got
anything to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macdougal shrugged.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who else?&rdquo; he
asked.&nbsp; More whiskey than was discreet had loosened up his
tongue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who else do you think?&nbsp; Who else but
Acey Smith keeps every straw-boss in the camp jumpy all the time
just so they won&rsquo;t get too busy comparin&rsquo; notes and
find out what&rsquo;s what?&nbsp; That man&rsquo;s a devil, and
there ain&rsquo;t two ways about that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got next to this stunt through an accident,&rdquo;
the cook went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was over hidin&rsquo; in some
green stuff on the side of the Second Hill the other morning
figurin&rsquo; on snipin&rsquo; a couple of partridge when I sees
you go by on the tote road.&nbsp; Then I see a long,
skinny-lookin&rsquo; Indian slippin&rsquo; through the brush
close to my hide after you.&nbsp; A couple of minutes more and
along comes old Leather Face, the Medicine Man, as pompous as you
please, but it ain&rsquo;t long before I discovers that his nibs
is a-watchin&rsquo; both of you, though he makes a big face of
bein&rsquo; unconcerned and about his own business.&nbsp; Now,
what do you think of that layout, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond was thoughtful.&nbsp; If he were to admit the truth
his breath was literally taken away by the revelation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Smith must attach a lot of importance to me to hire two of
them to watch me,&rdquo; was what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so sure <i>both</i> of them is hired to
watch you,&rdquo; observed his friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Medicine men
are too stuck on themselves to do shadowin&rsquo; jobs.&nbsp;
They go after bigger stuff.&nbsp; Smith uses them to put the fear
of the Lord into the Indian workers when he needs them.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s one of <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>the reasons why he lets old fakirs like Bush loaf around
the camp and do what they please.&nbsp; No Indian gives any back
talk about what the Medicine Man says or does, because they think
he can make a <i>Windigo</i> any time he feels like it to bring
them bad luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Sandy,&rdquo; urged Hammond,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s your theory?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll admit
it&rsquo;s got me beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got it figured out as one of two things,&rdquo;
replied the cook.&nbsp; &ldquo;Either you&rsquo;re hired by
outside parties to get something on Smith or the North Star
he&rsquo;s afraid you&rsquo;ll find out, and he&rsquo;s
havin&rsquo; you shadowed&mdash;or else, well, don&rsquo;t take
offence if I say it plain that this looks to me more like it:
you&rsquo;ve been sent out here by some of the higher-ups for him
to take care of you and he has that Indian guy watchin&rsquo; to
see that nothin&rsquo; happens to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens,&rdquo; Hammond expostulated,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a child or a green-horn in the woods that I
can&rsquo;t look after myself.&nbsp; Smith knows that.&nbsp; No,
no, Sandy, you&rsquo;re away out on your theories this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I now?&rdquo; ruffled the cook.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me
tell you Smith knows too that you ain&rsquo;t any smarter than
some of the other fellows who paid for their smartness by
cashin&rsquo; in to some kind of a lurkin&rsquo; death out there
in the sticks that comes down on a man without any warnin&rsquo;
and lets him into Kingdom Come without even a yelp bein&rsquo;
heard from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond was convinced the liquor in Sandy was doing the
talking now.&nbsp; But he tactfully asked: &ldquo;Ever know of
anything like that happening to any one, or is it just some of
that camp gossip about spooks over on the mountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Camp gossip and spooks me eye!&rdquo; derided the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t there been men disappeared around
here just as if they was swallowed up bones and all by something
roamin&rsquo; round the hills?&nbsp; Yes, I know what
you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>to say next about accidents
happenin&rsquo;, and all that sort of thing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Course
there&rsquo;s muck-holes in the muskegs that they might have
walked into or been pushed into and never be seen again.&nbsp;
But nobody here thinks that&rsquo;s just what happened.&nbsp; No,
sir, you couldn&rsquo;t tell them that.&nbsp; There ain&rsquo;t
an Indian will go up in them hills west of here after sundown for
life nor money, and whites that are wise won&rsquo;t do it
neither.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen.&nbsp; This much I know from what I saw
myself.&nbsp; Last summer there was a pale-faced city gink come
out here on a loafin&rsquo; holiday.&nbsp; He came pretty much
like you did and nobody knew anything about him unless it was the
super., who keeps what he knows to himself.&nbsp; This lad put in
his time makin&rsquo; pictures on pieces of card-board on a frame
of sticks he took around with him.&nbsp; The Big Boss warned him
and everybody else warned him if he left the camps not to wander
off the tote roads, and to keep away from the hill they call the
Cup of Nannabijou.&nbsp; But it didn&rsquo;t do any good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One morning they finds his hat floatin&rsquo; in the
lake back of the beaver dam on Solomon Creek.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
the creek that runs down the hill into the river and has the
rapids in it.&nbsp; They never found anything else, not a hair or
a bit of the hide of him.&nbsp; D&rsquo;you get that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely slipped and fell into the rapids,&rdquo;
suggested Hammond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what one of them coroner&rsquo;s juries
would say,&rdquo; agreed the cook, &ldquo;but you couldn&rsquo;t
make any old timers out here believe it.&nbsp; Besides, his
picture-drawing outfit was found a couple of hundred yards away
from the creek all set up the way he&rsquo;d been workin&rsquo;
on it when he got his.&nbsp; The Indians always said there was
one of their ancient devils lived up in The Cup on the hill, and
the rest of us is prepared to believe there&rsquo;s something
uncanny there it ain&rsquo;t good business to monkey
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>Macdougal fished out his watch.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cripes,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s eleven and
I should&rsquo;ve been back at the cook-house half an hour
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put his bottle back under the boards after a final
rejuvenator.&nbsp; At the door of the cabin he paused unsteadily
as though gripped by an after-thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyway,
Hammond, I&rsquo;d pack a gun if I was you,&rdquo; he
advised.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you ain&rsquo;t got a gat. of your own,
there&rsquo;s an army six-gun and some shells to fit it in that
pack of mine on the wall, and you&rsquo;re welcome to the loan of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Hammond could thank him he was gone and soon there
resounded from the cook-house a mixture of expletives and highly
ornamented opinions in general on &ldquo;worthless,
soldierin&rsquo; bull cooks&rdquo; which proved that Sandy, plus
dispensary whiskey, was trying to make up for lost time over the
pots and pans.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>That afternoon Hammond wandered out into the woods to quietly
think things over.&nbsp; He selected a spot at the top of a bald
hill where any one shadowing him would have difficulty in finding
sufficient cover within a hundred yards in any given
direction.&nbsp; Lighting his pipe, he started piecing things
together as they had occurred since he made that extraordinary
bargain with Norman T. Gildersleeve on the night of September the
twenty-third.&nbsp; First, Gildersleeve had engaged him to come
out here and put in his time any old way he cared to so long as
he did not disclose his identity or the facts of his bargain with
Gildersleeve.&nbsp; Secondly, Gildersleeve had confided nothing
to him as to the object of his mission and had not even told him
that he, Gildersleeve, was the head of the corporation that
financed the company that had gained the cutting rights on the <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>Nannabijou
Limits over the head of the North Star Towing and Contracting
Company now in control.&nbsp; In the third place, there was the
cold fact that Gildersleeve had almost immediately disappeared
and Hammond was left in the air out at the pulp camp, an object
of suspicion constantly shadowed and still left totally at sea as
to what he was to do next.</p>
<p>He initiated some of the methods he had used with considerable
success in his old police court reporting days to devise
plausible theories for crime mysteries, but none of them seemed
to work.&nbsp; Gildersleeve for one thing was a keen, hard-headed
business man.&nbsp; If he wasn&rsquo;t he could never have
reached and maintained a place at the head of a big financial
corporation.&nbsp; He had certainly shown no symptoms of mental
derangement while Hammond had been talking to him, and, if he had
been stricken with aphasia, as the papers said, it must have been
after he left the train at Moose Horn Station.&nbsp; Therefore,
when he engaged Hammond, a total stranger to him previously, at
one thousand dollars a month plus his keep and a hundred dollars
as a camouflage salary, he must have had some deep, important
motive.&nbsp; It could not have been for espionage work; in fact,
Hammond remembered, Gildersleeve had emphasised the point that
he, Hammond, would not be asked to do anything more than hold
down any job that was assigned to him and keep his identity
concealed.</p>
<p>There was every reason to conclude, Hammond theorised, that
the whole object of his residence at the pulp camp was to make
himself a mystery.&nbsp; Perhaps he was thus unconsciously
impersonating some one else for a purpose that only more
knowledge of the situation would disclose.&nbsp; This theory was
plausible enough when he sized the thing up from the angle of his
agreement with Gildersleeve alone.</p>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>There
had been surrounding circumstances, however, that led him
mentally around in circles and up against baffling blank
walls.&nbsp; There had been the strange perturbation of Eulas
Daly, the U. S. consul, when the latter had broached Hammond
regarding meeting Gildersleeve, and the appearance of the
dark-eyed woman wearing the sable furs on the platform of Moose
Horn Station after Gildersleeve had gone out wearing his overcoat
and carrying his bag with no apparent intention of returning to
catch the train.&nbsp; A woman does not get off a train at a
wilderness station in the dead of the night merely to look around
for pleasure, and the mystery of her performance was heightened
by her subsequent appearance at the pulp camp in search of Acey
Smith.&nbsp; She was known there, for Sandy Macdougal had spoken
familiarly of her as &ldquo;Yvonne,&rdquo; but had afterwards
refused to discuss her.</p>
<p>Acey Smith&rsquo;s question about aphasia that first night he
had arrived at the Nannabijou Limits struck Hammond as a very,
very odd coincidence&mdash;if it was a coincidence.&nbsp; Still,
Acey Smith could not have had definite knowledge of the manner of
Gildersleeve&rsquo;s disappearance at that stage of
proceedings.&nbsp; So Hammond discarded that incident as
unsolvable for the present and therefore an impediment to clear
thinking.</p>
<p>The Girl with the High-arched Eyebrows constantly limned up in
the background of all his conjectures, a beautiful, distracting
presence, but Hammond could not bring himself to the point of
concluding she was in any way consciously connected with this
queer business.&nbsp; She might be Gildersleeve&rsquo;s private
secretary, or even his daughter, which circumstances might
explain her visit to the camp as one in quest of possible
information as to Gildersleeve&rsquo;s whereabouts.&nbsp; But the
articles in the papers made no mention of any one accompanying
Gildersleeve on his journey, and, if there had been, that point
would <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>scarcely be overlooked, though it sorely puzzled Hammond
on that same score how it was no mention was made of Eulas Daly
being with the magnate.&nbsp; Why was it that Daly didn&rsquo;t
tell what he knew about the matter?</p>
<p>Finally, there was Gildersleeve&rsquo;s instruction to Hammond
to stick to his post at the pulp camp no matter what happened
until such time as he was communicated with.&nbsp; Possible
happenings in Gildersleeve&rsquo;s mind could not have included
his dropping out of sight.</p>
<p>Out of it all Hammond could sift but two simple conclusions
that would stand analysis, one of which was that Gildersleeve had
actually been stricken and was wandering about the West somewhere
without knowledge of who he was, and the other that Gildersleeve
must have met with foul play and the man who was seen above
Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, was some one else so afflicted, or
feigning such affliction, who strongly resembled him.</p>
<p>In the first case, Hammond&rsquo;s remaining at the camp would
be useless unless Gildersleeve suddenly recovered and returned to
his duties.&nbsp; The second possibility would make it incumbent
upon Hammond to tell the authorities what he knew with the least
possible delay.</p>
<p>It all left him in a dilemma as to how he should act and take
no chances on making a blunder of things.&nbsp; But
wait&mdash;there was one link in the mystery, one of the first
links at that that he had so far overlooked in the matter of its
possibilities.&nbsp; That link was Eulas Daly, U. S. consul at
Kam City, the man who had brought about his meeting with
Gildersleeve.&nbsp; Why not slip over to the city and see
Daly?&nbsp; Daly might be able to throw new light on the
situation without Hammond disclosing anything that was
confidential between himself and Gildersleeve.&nbsp; He would see
about that at once anyway.</p>
<p>Hammond glanced at his watch and sprang to his <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>feet.&nbsp; A
tug would be pulling out for Kam City in less than an hour.&nbsp;
That would just give him time to get back to camp and change his
clothes for the trip.&nbsp; He planned to spend the night and the
following day in the city if Daly&rsquo;s information were
re-assuring.&nbsp; If it were not he felt he must immediately see
the police and tell them what he knew.</p>
<p>The young man hurried over the trail quite unconscious of the
lithe, dark figure that rose from its hiding place at the edge of
the bush and stole along in his wake as silent as a shadow.&nbsp;
He reached the camp, changed his clothes, had a bite to eat in
Sandy Macdougal&rsquo;s kitchen and hurried to the
superintendent&rsquo;s quarters in search of a pass over on the
tug.</p>
<p>Hammond was due to run into two new surprises, the first of
which was a galling disappointment and the second of such a
thrilling nature from a purely speculative standpoint that, for
the time being, he forgot all about the first.</p>

87</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
A MASTER MIND!</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Artemus Duff</span>, president and general
manager of the Kam City Pulp and Paper Mills, subsidiary-to-be of
the International Investment Corporation, was in a very much
perturbed state of mind.&nbsp; Mr. Duff was an excitable person,
though otherwise a normal, hardheaded type of big business
circles, quite inured to the ordinary run of difficulties that
beset new undertakings such as the Kam City Pulp and Paper
Mills.&nbsp; But since his recent arrival from Toronto in Kam
City a tremendous responsibility had been shifted to his
shoulders, and though construction and installation at the mill
had been progressing well up on schedule time, there were other
incidentals that worried him exceedingly.</p>
<p>A plump little man with a round, clocklike face and rather
small pale blue eyes, he sat chewing at an unlighted cigar and
tilting back in a swivel office chair across the desk from Martin
Winch, K.C., senior member of the legal firm of Winch, Stanton
and Reid, solicitors for the Kam City Pulp and Paper Mills
Company.&nbsp; Martin Winch, incidentally, was known to have been
a confidential adviser of Norman T. Gildersleeve, head of the
parent company that financed the paper manufacturing
concern.&nbsp; The interview had been at Duff&rsquo;s earnest
solicitation, the latter having an obsession that
&ldquo;something ought to be done&rdquo; without a clear
conception of what the &ldquo;something&rdquo; should be.&nbsp;
The lawyer&rsquo;s calm, unruffled <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>manner of viewing the situation
irritated Duff, who declared that &ldquo;nobody seemed to see the
crisis ahead except himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gildersleeve&rsquo;s disappearance has, as you
state, occurred at a very critical period,&rdquo; Winch
agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, on the other hand, Mr. Duff, all the
machinery is complete in the way of contracts and agreements
protecting us, and I can&rsquo;t see that there is anything more
that we can do than sit tight and see that the North Star Towing
and Contracting Company&rsquo;s order from the government for
delivery of the raw product to us is carried out
expeditiously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite well aware of all that,&rdquo; discounted
the president of the Kam City Pulp and Paper Mills, &ldquo;and if
Norman Gildersleeve were in the offing somewhere, or even if I
knew exactly the plans he had in the back of his head when he
approved of our agreement with the Ontario government and thereby
agreed to the cutting and delivering contract on the part of the
North Star Company I shouldn&rsquo;t waste a moment&rsquo;s worry
over matters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind the responsibility of taking full
charge of affairs,&rdquo; he emphasised, &ldquo;if I had a notion
of Gildersleeve&rsquo;s preconceived plans for meeting possible
trickery on the part of the North Star; but Gildersleeve,
apparently, took nobody into his confidence on that
score.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But so far the North Star Company have not shown any
tendency to violate the terms of the government fiat imposed on
them,&rdquo; argued the lawyer.&nbsp; &ldquo;In fact, I
understand they have now almost the required amount of poles
boomed in Nannabijou Bay ready for delivery to the mill.&nbsp; To
my way of thinking, outside of the unfortunate disappearance of
Mr. Gildersleeve, everything looks exceedingly rosy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; stormed Duff.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Everything looks <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>rosy&mdash;too damned
rosy!&rdquo;&nbsp; He slammed his badly mangled cigar into a
nearby waste-basket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everything looks too damned
rosy to be of good omen where such notorious pirates as the North
Star Towing and Contracting Company are concerned.&nbsp; Winch,
are you conscious of the fact that the North Star has smashed and
utterly ruined every commercial enterprise that has attempted to
enter into competition with them in the North?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;circumstances alter cases,&rdquo; hedged
the lawyer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Things are different&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;re different,&rdquo; derided
Duff.&nbsp; &ldquo;The North Star never tackles two swindling
campaigns with the same methods or their victims would learn to
plan successful counter attacks.&nbsp; Look you, Winch,
I&rsquo;ve been delving a bit into local history just for the
very purpose of studying these people and their methods.&nbsp;
Through political manipulation, bribery, legal trickery and
downright commercial theft and robbery, when they could get away
with it, they have utterly destroyed every enterprise that has
threatened to interfere with their exclusive exploitation of the
resources of this northern country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit they&rsquo;ve been
unscrupulous&mdash;brazenly unscrupulous and aggressive,&rdquo;
quietly returned the man of the law, &ldquo;but I think you
exaggerate somewhat, Mr. Duff.&nbsp; I could name you a dozen
concerns competitive of the North Star Company that have thrived
for years without interference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All small-fry concerns,&rdquo; pointed out the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;The North Star&rsquo;s apparent policy has
been to let the little fellows alone&mdash;even nurse them
financially at times with an end in view; it finds them useful
allies when there&rsquo;s government lobbying afoot or a big
political coup to be pulled off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
been the fate of every enterprise of dimensions that has
attempted to <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>exist within the zone of the North Star&rsquo;s
activities?&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t the Upper Lakes Towing and
Salvaging Company at one time the most flourishing marine concern
on Lake Superior?&nbsp; What did the North Star do to them?&nbsp;
Swept them from the North Shore till they hadn&rsquo;t a
propeller turning between here and the Soo.&nbsp; What happened
the Independent Fur Trading Company that once held exclusive
trading treaties with the Indians all the way north to the Bay
Company&rsquo;s boundaries?&nbsp; The North Star weaned their
business away from them by selling the Indians alleged cough
medicine that was five per cent pure alcohol and drove them out
paupers.&nbsp; Where is the Oliphant Transfer Ship Company that
enjoyed practically all the marine switching business in northern
harbours?&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve been supplanted by the Kam City
Leg-boat Corporation, subsidiary to the North Star.&nbsp;
Who&rsquo;s behind the All-West Trading and Storage Limited that
ousted the Dominion Grain Dealers and grabbed off all their
elevators between here and The Hat?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the North
Star&mdash;everybody knows that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I could go on enumerating until it sounded like a
book of epitaphs from a commercial graveyard,&rdquo; continued
Duff.&nbsp; &ldquo;The North Star did not pay thirty cents on the
dollar of value for the business of any one of the unfortunate
concerns it squelched out and absorbed.&nbsp; It was all
accomplished by business buccaneering methods unparalleled on
this continent for audacity and cunning.&nbsp; In every case, so
far as I can learn, it was a totally unexpected coup, swift and
certain as lightning, that crumpled up the North Star&rsquo;s
rivals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These things are what you&rsquo;d call precedent in
legal parlance, Winch,&rdquo; opined Duff, &ldquo;and therefore,
what we&rsquo;ve got to figure on meeting from the North Star is
the unexpected&mdash;like a bolt from a clear sky.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>II</h3>
<p>Martin Winch fussed with a sheaf of clipped typewritten sheets
before him.&nbsp; &ldquo;They cannot very well get away with any
trickery in the face of this government order,&rdquo; he
persisted laconically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a scrap of paper so far as the North Star is
concerned,&rdquo; asserted Duff.&nbsp; &ldquo;Legally it may be
watertight from forty-nine different angles, but there&rsquo;s
bound to be a fiftieth with a loop-hole in it that nobody ever
thought of but the North Star Company.&nbsp; You knew, of course,
that Gildersleeve sensed this very thing; that he left New York
this last time with the express purpose of thwarting some
nefarious plot the North Star were hatching up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo; Winch appeared to
be evincing a mild interest now.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Gildersleeve
never even hinted at such a thing in his
correspondence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the trouble,&rdquo; complained the
paper mill president.&nbsp; &ldquo;Norman Gildersleeve
didn&rsquo;t take any of us into his confidence with regard to
his inside information and his definite plans, and when he
dropped out of sight at this critical period he left us all
helpless and in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure Mr. Gildersleeve had reason to suspect
treachery on the part of the North Star?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know this much: He employed two of the cleverest
detectives in the country to run down something crooked afoot on
the Nannabijou Limits.&nbsp; One of the detectives returned a
broken-down wreck of a man; the other just dropped out of
sight.&nbsp; His hat was found floating on a creek at the limits
and that&rsquo;s all they ever heard of him afterwards.&nbsp; I
do know that Gildersleeve got a line on something that means
disaster for the Kam City Paper Mills if it is not thwarted in
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Martin
Winch drummed his fingers on the glass top of his desk and stared
at the ceiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet I can&rsquo;t see that anything
short of hiring some one to blow up the mill would accomplish
such an end for the North Star,&rdquo; he observed
skeptically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which would be a crude, bolshevik method altogether
lacking the finesse of the North Star.&nbsp; No, Winch,
they&rsquo;re figuring on getting the machinery that&rsquo;s
going into that mill of ours away from us for just what
they&rsquo;ll care to pay when they have us with our backs to the
wall.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m becoming positive that&rsquo;s the
objective of their plot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have deeper reasons for your suspicions than
appear on the surface, Mr. Duff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have.&nbsp; But, Good Lord, man, aren&rsquo;t the
surface indications sufficient?&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the North Star
Company that once held exclusive cutting rights on all the
available northern limits, docilely, tamely, allowing their
initiative to pass into the hands of outside capital without even
a murmur of protest.&nbsp; Tell me, does that look natural?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s all the more ominous because up to the eleventh hour
of our securing permanent rights on the Nannabijou Limits they
have fulfilled their part of the contract to the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it strike you as passing strange that the
North Star, which owned or controlled all the tugs and loading
machinery on the upper end of the lake, accepted without even the
slightest protest the government&rsquo;s proposal that they cut
and deliver the required poles that would make our acquisition of
the limits complete?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did seem odd at the time,&rdquo; admitted the
lawyer, &ldquo;but then, they no doubt feared that obstruction of
the government&rsquo;s policy might have meant another order
ousting them from the limits at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; And you must know that&rsquo;s
nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Mr.
Duff arose and paced the floor, jammed another unlighted cigar
between his teeth and sat down again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Winch,&rdquo;
he suggested, &ldquo;just let us take the whole situation as it
obtains to date, stand it on end, so to speak, and take a square
look at it.&nbsp; Then tell me if you still think the present
lamblike attitude of the notorious North Star timber pirates
looks natural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, the North Star at one time owned
outright or held cutting rights on practically all the pulpwood
contingent to water-haul from the North Shore, with the exception
of the crown lands known as the Nannabijou Limits, didn&rsquo;t
they?&nbsp; Well, back in those days the Ontario government had
very little notion of the immense forest wealth of the
North.&nbsp; The North Star got most of the concessions for a
song, through political pull, graft, intimidation and downright
theft in some cases.&nbsp; They bribed government officials right
and left, moved survey lines overnight, had cruisers make false
estimates, took out fake mining patents, and, on the pretence of
cutting trails and tote roads in to mine sites that never
existed, skinned the territory of all its best timber.&nbsp; They
left a trail of commercial iniquity behind them, unparalleled on
this continent, until it became a by-word that the North Star
would rather win out by putting the law in contempt than accept a
gift where everything was above board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The huge block of crown lands known as the Nannabijou
Limits was the only territory held sacred from their nefarious
exploitation.&nbsp; Government after government remained firm to
the pledge of the late Sir John Whitson, when he was prime
minister, that not a stick would be cut on the Nannabijou that
was not manufactured into paper in Kam City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The North Star long had their covetous eyes on the
Nannabijou Limits.&nbsp; They wanted them worse than any <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>other
concession in the North, because they knew the Nannabijou,
bisected as it is by a great river with tributaries extending for
miles and miles inland, meant the domination of the pulp and
paper industry once it was secured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the North Star Company were exporters,&rdquo;
continued Duff.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is pretty well established that
the North Star, controlled by Canadians whom no one has ever
seemed able to name, owns two big paper mills in Eastern
Ontario.&nbsp; They tried by every black artifice at their
command to fleece the government for the Nannabijou and to get
the embargo on export to the East in the raw state removed.&nbsp;
But the government stood firm by the Whitson pledge and they
failed in their attempts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matters came swiftly to a head when we came on the
scene and started to build a paper mill.&nbsp; The acute paper
shortage had most to do with it.&nbsp; The government, tired of
bickering and of the North Star&rsquo;s professional lobbyists,
suddenly announced that it was going to throw the Nannabijou
Limits open for tender, and that the limits would be leased to
the highest bidder simultaneously contracting to manufacture
exclusively in Kam City and have a paper mill with a capacity of
three hundred and fifty tons of paper a day in full operation by
October the twenty-third of this present year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a drastic contract, so drastic that only the
serious paper famine threatening would excuse any government for
creating it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Along with other Canadian associates holding stock in
the International Investment Corporation, I went down to New York
to consult Norman Gildersleeve, the president, about it.&nbsp;
Gildersleeve went thoroughly into the cruisers&rsquo; reports and
the terms of the government agreement, and, to our surprise,
almost immediately decided we should make a bid for the limits
under all the <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>terms laid down.&nbsp; We had part of the machinery on
order for some time which would equip just such a modern mill as
was required, he pointed out, and the only problem that
confronted us was the securing of tugs and loading machinery for
handling the poles between the limits and the mill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I expected took place.&nbsp; Immediately the
North Star got busy building a paper mill on a site in Kam City,
and they put in a tender for the limits simultaneously with
ours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The North Star Company were the successful
tenderers.&nbsp; They were granted a year&rsquo;s cutting rights
with the privilege of renewing at the same figures provided they
had commenced installing their machinery by June and were in full
operation by October.&nbsp; Gildersleeve was not the least taken
back.&nbsp; He said he expected it, but he told us to wait and
see.&nbsp; You remember what happened.&nbsp; The North Star had
no machinery to install in their mill by June.&nbsp; Gildersleeve
and his associates put the skids under them by manipulating the
market so that the United States plant manufacturing the North
Star&rsquo;s paper-making machinery went into bankruptcy and our
people gaining control of it held the machinery.&nbsp; That left
the North Star nicely in the air.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t
another manufacturer could guarantee the construction of the
machinery required in less than twenty-seven months&rsquo; time,
partially on account of the scarcity of steel at that time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hon. J. J. Slack and his bevy of lawyers moved
heaven and earth to get the time extended to two years and six
months, but the government stood pat.&nbsp; Our original tender
was accepted to date from the expiration of the North
Star&rsquo;s on October the twenty-third and we were to be given
possession of all wood cut by the North Star this season on the
Nannabijou.&nbsp; To appease the <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>powerful North Star Company, however,
the government inserted a rider in the agreement that should we
fail in any particular of our contract, even through unforeseen
accident, our lease on the limits would be automatically
cancelled and that of the North Star would be immediately
reinstated with an extension of time for the installation of
their machinery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then followed our fight against the eleventh hour
inclusion of that drastic rider.&nbsp; It was all to no
avail.&nbsp; The government, having satisfied the public that
they meant business in getting the limits developed and a paper
mill built, were prepared to wash their hands of the whole
affair.&nbsp; We were as much as told we could either take it or
leave it, as we pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Winch,&rdquo; concluded Duff, &ldquo;in the
face of the North Star&rsquo;s immediate willingness to act as
contractor for us in getting out the poles on time when they
could otherwise have left us in a mighty awkward fix for tugs,
can&rsquo;t you see that they have but one aim in this whole
business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have some definite plan for putting it over us so
that we can&rsquo;t live up to the terms of our agreement with
the government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my dear Duff&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, I&rsquo;m not crazy nor drunk either,&rdquo;
insisted Duff.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have definite information that it
was just this very possibility that Norman Gildersleeve was on
his way here to thwart when he dropped out of sight.&nbsp; To be
candid with you, old man, I came up here purposely to-day just to
mull this whole thing over aloud to see if I could get a slant on
what Gildersleeve suspected or if you could supply a clue.&nbsp;
I confess I&rsquo;m just as much in the dark as ever as to what
move the North Star could make between now and the twenty-third
of October <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>to injure us.&nbsp; However, I have put a squad of
guards on the booms in Nannabijou Bay to see that no
trickery&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>The telephone bell interrupted Duff with an insistent
jangling.&nbsp; Winch answered the call.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Slack,&rdquo; he said, placing a hand over the receiver.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He wants to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed the desk instrument to Duff.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hello&mdash;yes, Duff speaking, Slack,&rdquo; answered the
latter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been back in town since
yesterday&mdash;&nbsp; Yes, it is unfortunate about
Gildersleeve&mdash; No, nothing concerning him except what
I&rsquo;ve read in the papers&mdash;&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
that?&mdash;&nbsp; Yes, pretty busy&mdash;&nbsp; You are going
out of town for a few days?&mdash;&nbsp; Well, right after you
come back&mdash;&nbsp; Let me know and I&rsquo;ll drop
over&mdash;&nbsp; Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duff put up the phone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, how the devil did he
find out I was here?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I left no word
at the hotel nor at the plant as to where I was going.&nbsp;
Wants to have a talk with me about something important right
after he gets back from a trip to Ottawa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duff rose and picked up his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slack&rsquo;s an oily customer,&rdquo; commented Martin
Winch stifling a sigh of relief that the interview with this
fussy little man was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oily is the word, but I&rsquo;m pretty well convinced
he&rsquo;s nothing more than a straw-boss at that,&rdquo;
returned Duff.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a mint of money, and
so would a number of other people, to know who does Slack&rsquo;s
thinking for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duff departed in a finicky mood.&nbsp; A nasty doubt was
growing within him as to the degree of co-operation he might
expect from the Kam City Pulp and Paper Mills&rsquo; lawyer, a
doubt engendered by Winch&rsquo;s apathetic attitude.&nbsp; <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>No doubt
Martin Winch, K.C., in common with many others, entertained a
wholesome respect for the uncanny power of the North Star Company
and its penchant for sooner or later squaring accounts with those
who became over-zealous in meddling with its affairs.&nbsp; The
disappearance of Norman T. Gildersleeve, head of the parent
company controlling the Kam City Company, at this critical moment
had more than likely shattered the initiative of Winch, who
seemed to have small confidence in Duff&rsquo;s ability to cope
single-handed with the cunning of the North Star.&nbsp; It might
be, grimly speculated Duff, that Winch was seriously considering
the matter of throwing up his retainer and allowing some other
legal firm to appropriate the fee and the hazards that went with
it.</p>

99</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
THE WONDER GIRL</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first of the two surprises
Louis Hammond experienced that evening he returned from the woods
intending to take the tug to Kam City to interview Eulas Daly was
that he was as good as marooned on the Nannabijou Limits.&nbsp;
He sought out Mooney, the assistant superintendent, mentioning
that he would like to secure a pass over to the city and
back.&nbsp; Mooney issued most of the passes to the men
travelling back and forward.</p>
<p>The assistant superintendent grinned wryly and shook his
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will have to see the Big Boss about
it,&rdquo; he said and resumed his cursory inspection of pole
counters&rsquo; returns.</p>
<p>This was exceedingly aggravating, for the tug was almost ready
to pull out and Acey Smith was not to be found.&nbsp; He did not
show up at his office till long after the tug had gone out.&nbsp;
Hammond followed him in, determined to secure a pass for the
morning boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to run over to the city on the tug in
the morning,&rdquo; he announced.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mooney told me
I&rsquo;d have to see you about getting a pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry to deny you your little holiday,&rdquo;
returned the other, &ldquo;but for the present I can do no more
for you than Mooney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are virtually making a prisoner of
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that; you voluntarily made a
prisoner of yourself,&rdquo; reminded the superintendent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>brought me a letter from J. J. Slack, president of the
North Star Company, instructing me to keep you hidden
here&mdash;at least that is what I gathered from its
contents&mdash;and until I receive other instructions I must
abide by that request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acey Smith spoke quietly, without trace of malice.&nbsp; The
usual half-sneer on his lips was lacking.&nbsp; Hammond could not
safely justify a denial that he was the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of
Slack; his promise to Gildersleeve precluded that.&nbsp; There
was nothing he could say.</p>
<p>The pulp camp superintendent seemed anxious to pass over the
embarrassing situation, for he said almost immediately:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity we have to work at cross-purposes,
Hammond.&nbsp; Believe me, I hate to deny you such a small favour
as a pass over to the city&mdash;but that, just now, is not
exactly a possibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Smith.&rdquo; Hammond turned on a heel
and strode out.</p>
<p>Acey Smith&rsquo;s new mood baffled him.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, he
reflected as he strolled down to the river before returning to
his quarters, the superintendent was the creature of Slack or
others of the company over him, but Gildersleeve must have
realised this sort of thing would happen when he placed him on
the limits through the agency of Slack.&nbsp; Was it all a sham
of some sort&mdash;or was Gildersleeve actually in the first
stages of madness when he concocted this seemingly crazy plan for
Hammond to play the part of a fugitive from justice on the
limits?&nbsp; Meanwhile, if Gildersleeve did not sooner or later
turn up in his right mind where would it all end?</p>
<p>He must get to Kam City, even if he had to hide on one of the
tugs, he decided.&nbsp; There would be little use in keeping up
the present farce if Gildersleeve were unable to fulfill the part
he planned, and, in the face of the fact that no trace of him had
yet been discovered, that seemed <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>unlikely.&nbsp; There could be
nothing wrong in disregarding an agreement with a man who was no
longer able to carry out his side of the contract, and Eulas
Daly, the United States consul, who had brought him into contact
with Gildersleeve, should be able to let in a little light on the
mystery.&nbsp; Then, if there appeared to be any use in so doing,
he hoped he would be able to get back on one of the tugs without
getting into undue complications and resume his old r&ocirc;le at
the limits.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-hish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond&rsquo;s cogitation was startlingly interrupted by the
faintly spoken warning as a figure leaned forward from the shadow
of a clump of willows and seizing his nearest hand squeezed
something small and square into the palm of it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look&mdash;walk on&mdash;some one might
see,&rdquo; came a low, hoarse whisper, then the other seemed to
melt into the darkness.</p>
<p>Hammond took the cue from the unknown messenger and pursued
his way to his quarters with an assumption of unconcern that he
by no means possessed.&nbsp; The suddenness of it had
considerably startled him.&nbsp; Sandy Macdougal was not yet in
when Hammond arrived, and the latter, sitting close to the wall
where his actions could not be observed from the outside through
the window, examined the folded bit of paper which the stranger
had pressed into his hand.&nbsp; It bore no address on the
outside, and the faint scrawl in backhand on the inner side was
unfamiliar:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">The young lady stopping on Amethyst Island,
west of the camp, may need a friend.&nbsp; Why not stroll out
that way to-morrow morning?</p>
<p>That was all.&nbsp; What the devil did it all mean?</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>The
young lady referred to could be none other than the Girl with the
High-arched Eyebrows&mdash;&nbsp; Hammond&rsquo;s fingers
gripping the note trembled.&nbsp; He had several times started
out for the vicinity of Amethyst Island, and each time at thought
of actually meeting her turned back.&nbsp; Now&mdash;now, armed
with this note, there would be a legitimate excuse&mdash;</p>
<p>At the sound of foot-steps outside he hurriedly folded the
note and secreted it in an inner pocket.</p>
<p>Sandy Macdougal plunged in and tossed a newspaper to
Hammond.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of the scalers brought it in when he
came over on the government launch to-night,&rdquo; he
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;See, this paper says that millionaire
chap, Gildersleeve, that disappeared off a train has been seen in
Montreal.&nbsp; Guess the gink must&rsquo;ve been celebrating
with a crock of bootleg hootch and passed his station,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond hastily read the headlines and the story which told of
a man of Norman T. Gildersleeve&rsquo;s appearance being seen
boarding a train west at the Windsor street station,
Montreal.&nbsp; That was about all there was to it.&nbsp; He
tossed the paper down in disgust.&nbsp; As an ex-newspaper man he
could thoroughly appreciate the avidity with which correspondents
and telegraph editors seize upon every tittle of rumour while a
big unsolved mystery grips the public&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy,&rdquo; he said, speaking his thoughts,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think there&rsquo;s something in
all that you were telling me this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook paused in the act of lighting his pipe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Any thing happened to make you believe that?&rdquo; he
asked casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Hammond, &ldquo;but I have had proof
that I am being shadowed around here, though by whom I
haven&rsquo;t a faint idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>Macdougal with ready generosity produced the revolver
and a box of cartridges.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better pack
these,&rdquo; he advised.</p>
<p>But Hammond had all a journalist&rsquo;s contempt for
firearms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks, Sandy,&rdquo; he declined.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather win through without it.&nbsp; I
haven&rsquo;t carried a gun since&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You left the army,&rdquo; supplied the cook when
Hammond paused cautiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d been
over there too.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you wear your service
button on the outside of your coat same as I do?&nbsp; The Big
Boss, for all he don&rsquo;t let on, has got a weakness for
returned men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sleepy, let&rsquo;s turn in,&rdquo; said
Hammond.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t really sleepy, but he wanted a chance to think
quietly.&nbsp; The truth of the matter was the young man viewed
that note that had been poked into his hand with considerable
suspicion.&nbsp; He did not know whether to conceive that the
intent was to lead him into some sort of a trap or make a
laughing-stock of him.&nbsp; In any case, he was going to see the
matter through.</p>
<p>Next morning he dressed with more than usual care, and when he
had breakfasted sauntered out one of the inland tote roads.&nbsp;
Out of sight of the camp, he cut down through the solid woods
until he reached the lake-shore trail, where he crossed the
Nannabijou River by way of the wooden suspension bridge built
there by the Indian workers.</p>
<p>It was a laughing autumn morning, crisp, with that mellow
sunlit stillness that prevails during the period in the latter
part of September and the earlier weeks in October before the
first great &ldquo;blow&rdquo; comes hurtling down along
Superior&rsquo;s north shore oft-times taking its grisly toll of
men and boats.&nbsp; There was an invigorating tang of spruce in
the air, and the mighty lake to Hammond&rsquo;s left lay like a
great shimmering sea of glass.&nbsp; Afar out on it grain
carriers rode lazily, trailing their <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>long, black plumes north and
south.&nbsp; In the brush to either side of the trail partridge
strutted noisily or drummed up into the peaks of the
evergreens.&nbsp; In the soft blue of the skies and the thin haze
of the horizons hung that infinite serenity of mid-autumn in the
majestic North.</p>
<p>Hammond forgot about the ruses he had planned to discover if
he were shadowed.&nbsp; The very gladness of Nature round and
about him made him whistle and sing like a boy, for all that a
certain shy nervousness was upon him.&nbsp; Such a morning breeds
recklessness in vigorous youth&mdash;a quest for Adventure and
Old Romance.</p>
<p>He topped a long slope, from which the trail dipped gradually
to the very edge of the lake at the foot of a wide ravine gashed
up the side of the mountain to his right to the plateau below the
forbidding black granite battlements of the Cup of
Nannabijou.&nbsp; Almost on his immediate left lay the tiny
Island of Amethyst with its soft wooded groves and grotesque,
old-fashioned bungalows.</p>
<p>Hammond&rsquo;s eyes swept from the island to the shoreline
opposite&mdash;then he stopped dead in his tracks with a sharp
intaking of breath.</p>
<p>Seated upon a fallen tree-trunk near the water&rsquo;s edge
where her canoe was drawn up, with the lake and the dense foliage
above and around her for a background, was a young woman whose
charm of face and figure held him for the moment in spellbound
admiration.</p>
<p>It was the Girl with the High-arched Eyebrows; she whom he had
now twice met under unusual circumstances, once in the parlour
car of a transcontinental train and again just below the doorway
of Acey Smith&rsquo;s office at the pulp camp.&nbsp; She was
obviously waiting for some one.&nbsp; So&mdash;so&mdash;could it
have been that she had actually sent for him?</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>She
was looking straight at him, expectancy, wonder in her great blue
eyes.&nbsp; With an effort he regained part of his composure and
plunged precipitously down the trail against a wild impulse to
turn on his heel and flee.</p>
<p>Somehow, he finally stood before her with bared head and
wildly-beating pulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I came in response to your note.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He did not stammer it so awkwardly as he feared he would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My note?&rdquo;&nbsp; The finely-pencilled brows were
elevated in bewitching perplexity.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>My</i>
note?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;the note you&mdash;I have it here
somewhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hammond at first searched vainly through
his pockets for the tiny bit of paper.&nbsp; He felt he was
somehow making a confounded ass of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&mdash;I wrote you no note.&nbsp; There must be
some mistake.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was the faintest trace of amused
curiosity in her tones.</p>
<p>Hammond suddenly felt like one who drops from the clouds into
a pit of gloom.&nbsp; Either he had been humbugged or he had
accosted the wrong woman.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>At last his fingers encountered the little folded
square.&nbsp; He opened it out and passed it to her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You see it was unsigned,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was not in a position to know who it was
from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was cut short by a soft peal of silvery laughter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Some one with an odd sense of humour is behind
this,&rdquo; she said passing the note back to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But the joke is on both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On both of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Last night I too found a note pushed under
the door of my cottage.&nbsp; It stated that a young man who was
stopping at the pulp camp would like to meet me here <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>this
morning, and that if I honoured the appointment it might be to
our mutual interest.&nbsp; So you see I obeyed the mysterious
summons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The notes then were most likely written by the same
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely.&nbsp; Mine was in a faint, back-hand
scrawl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some outside party,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;must
have been seriously interested in our becoming
acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would fancy so.&rdquo;&nbsp; There came a
mischievous light into her blue eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we are not
yet acquainted, are we, Mr. &mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hammond&mdash;Louis Hammond,&rdquo; he supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hammond, I am pleased to meet you.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
rose and extended her little hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am Miss
Josephine Stone&mdash;or, perhaps you already knew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;but I confess I have been curious to know,
ever since that night our eyes met on the train, or do you
remember that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;I do.&nbsp; You must have thought my
actions strange that night.&nbsp; But there were so many odd
things happened in that coach during the space of a few minutes I
had become quite perplexed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That brings us to a point where you might do me a great
service, Miss Stone,&rdquo; Hammond suggested eagerly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you any idea what happened Mr.
Gildersleeve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gildersleeve?&rdquo;&nbsp; There was blank
perplexity in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, you do not know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not remember ever having met a man of that
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond was dumfounded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pardon me, then,&rdquo;
he offered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had thought you were a
relative&mdash;or his secretary.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>&ldquo;Was he one of the men you were talking to on the
coach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Mr. Gildersleeve, so the papers say,
disappeared after leaving the train at Moose Horn Station that
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I remember reading something about that in
some of the papers brought over to the island.&nbsp; Was he the
tall, stern-faced man who left his stateroom and got off at a
little station shortly after you left him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Mr. Gildersleeve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought there was something mysterious about it
all,&rdquo; she said seriously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had been
travelling with a friend, Mrs. Johnson, from Calgary.&nbsp; From
Winnipeg east we were occupying a section in one of the other
coaches, but I had gone back to the parlour car alone to read for
awhile before I went to bed.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards, a dark,
striking-looking woman came in and took a chair near me.&nbsp; We
were alone at the time and I noticed she seemed to be keeping a
keen watch on the stateroom of the man you say was Mr.
Gildersleeve.&nbsp; First, there was a little grey-haired man
went in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Eulas Daly, an American consul,&rdquo;
explained Hammond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After he came out you later came up from the forward
part of the coach and entered Mr. Gildersleeve&rsquo;s
stateroom,&rdquo; continued Miss Stone.&nbsp; &ldquo;When the
door closed behind you, the dark woman leaned over and asked:
&lsquo;Do you know that man?&rsquo;&nbsp; I replied that I did
not.&nbsp; Then she said: &lsquo;His appearance fits the
description of a notorious western bandit.&nbsp; I am one of the
number of detectives who are shadowing him, so please don&rsquo;t
tell anybody what you see me doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I could recover from my surprise she tip-toed to
the stateroom and stood with her back to it and her hands behind
her.&nbsp; At first I thought she was simply <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>waiting for
you to come out.&nbsp; But when some little time later the porter
came up the aisle she hastily withdrew her hands and I saw she
had been holding against the door&rsquo;s key-hole a small black
boxlike instrument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dictaphone!&rdquo; Hammond gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I took it to be.&nbsp; She kept it
hidden from the porter and walked forward and out of the
coach.&nbsp; When you came out of Mr. Gildersleeve&rsquo;s room I
wanted to tell you about the woman&rsquo;s strange actions, but
you took one startled look at me and fled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus confirming the allegation that I was a
highwayman,&rdquo; Hammond laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know what to think,&rdquo; asserted Miss
Stone.&nbsp; &ldquo;After Mr. Gildersleeve left the train I saw
you come out of the smoker and walk out to the platform.&nbsp; I
summoned all my courage and followed as far as the platform
door.&nbsp; It was some time before I succeeded in catching your
eye.&nbsp; Then when I did I lost my nerve and ran away without
warning you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you would have warned me&mdash;even when there was
a possibility that I was a real desperado?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes dropped before his ardent ones.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; she replied deliberately,
&ldquo;one&rsquo;s sympathies <i>will</i> go out to&mdash;a
desperado.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the moment Hammond almost wished himself a highwayman, but
whatever his reply might have been it was stilled on his
lips.</p>
<p>From out of the heart of the hills came a melodious, gong-like
alarum, softly reverberating like the tone when exquisite
cut-glass is struck.</p>
<p>The man looked at the girl.&nbsp; In her eyes he read as great
bewilderment as his own.</p>
<h2><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>CHAPTER X<br />
THE WHITE MONSTER OF NANNABIJOU</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Again</span>, after a short interval, the
strange gong sounded while the pair stood speechless at the
water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; There was something terrifying in its
low note as it vibrated out of the early morning stillness of the
wilderness.&nbsp; It had seemed to cry out a protest against
intrusion in some fastness sanctuary&mdash;a warning of ominous
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where do you suppose that bell is
located?&rdquo;&nbsp; Hammond was first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea,&rdquo; Josephine
Stone answered.&nbsp; He could see she was suppressing
apprehension under her light laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have heard
it before, and it has startled&mdash;puzzled me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there is an Indian mission of some sort back in
those hills,&rdquo; he suggested, though it struck him it sounded
more like a huge gong than a church bell.</p>
<p>The girl shook her head dubiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe there&rsquo;s a soul living up there,&rdquo; she
asserted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Back of here is all barren
lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there seems to be a well worn trail running up from
here,&rdquo; Hammond indicated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you ever
explored it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ve wanted to just to find out where
that bell is.&nbsp; Mrs. Johnson is afraid we&rsquo;d get lost in
the bush and wouldn&rsquo;t consent to going unless one of our
Indians went with us.&nbsp; The Indians get excited even at
mention <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>of it; they say they are afraid of an evil spirit that
has its abode in those cliffs they call the Cup of
Nannabijou.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d never have the courage to go
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Hammond there came a thrilling possibility.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Would you care to go up there&mdash;with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked out over the expanse of lake anxiously and glanced
at her wrist-watch.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, not to-day.&nbsp; I find I
must be returning to the island.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then as she rose
she looked up at him with a smile that dissipated his twinge of
disappointment; &ldquo;But you will come again, Mr.
Hammond?&nbsp; Perhaps some morning we can arrange it.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Hammond did come again&mdash;almost every morning when the
weather was clear.&nbsp; They spent most of the time in her
launch or one of the canoes, trolling for lake trout and coasters
or exploring the many fantastic inlets along the North
Shore.&nbsp; On some occasions Mrs. Johnson, Miss Stone&rsquo;s
companion, accompanied them, but most of the time they went
alone, the elder woman not caring for the water.&nbsp; Of her
past or her reason for staying at Amethyst Island at this season
of the year the girl never spoke.&nbsp; Twice Hammond mentioned
Acey Smith, the superintendent of the pulp camps, and of the
latter&rsquo;s strange behaviour, but each time Miss Stone
adroitly changed the subject.&nbsp; But these aspects did not
weigh heavily upon Louis Hammond; he was too happy in her
company.&nbsp; What he most dreaded was an announcement that she
would be leaving.</p>
<p>In the thrall of his new adventure he ceased to worry over the
mystery of his mission to the limits or as to what had become of
Norman T. Gildersleeve.&nbsp; Of Acey Smith he saw as little as
possible.&nbsp; If Smith objected to his visits to Josephine
Stone at the island he said no <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>word about it; but once when Hammond
was striking off along the lakeshore trail he turned to glimpse
the Big Boss of the Nannabijou camps staring after him, a black
scowl on his face that spoke volumes.</p>
<p>There came the morning when they were to make the ascent to
the Cup of Nannabijou.&nbsp; He found her waiting for him by the
fallen tree-trunk attired in a blue riding coat, fawn riding
bloomers and high, laced tan walking boots, a costume that set
off to advantage the indescribable charm of her.</p>
<p>She greeted him with a quaint shyness.&nbsp; &ldquo;They told
me it would be impossible to get through the woods in
skirts,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why of course it would.&rdquo;&nbsp; His frank, boyish
admiration was reassuring.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should have told you
that myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all her fragile, girlish form he found her agile and
strong as a young deer, and in her close-fitting costume and
firm-soled walking boots she seemed quite as tireless as
he.&nbsp; They spoke but little, for the ascent was fairly steep,
and a few hundred yards from the lake-shore it became almost
precipitous in places.&nbsp; At times the trail went up anglewise
in a series of steps across the face of cliffs; then for a space
they would travel over gentle slopes of heavily wooded
territory.&nbsp; Always she kept to his side with a companionable
nearness that made him utterly forget the toil of the
climb.&nbsp; Over the very steep places she accepted his arm.</p>
<p>The trail took them to the summit of a bald hump of ages-old
lava rock shaped like the top of a huge beehive.&nbsp; From there
the view in the crystal northern sunlight was magnificent.&nbsp;
Before them stretched the valley of Solomon Creek, and along the
base of the cliffs a translucent ribbon of mist disclosed the
tortuous course of the stream down to where the vapour expanded
into <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>a
great spade-shaped cloud above the lake formed by a beaver-dam
near the creek&rsquo;s confluence with the Nannabijou
River.&nbsp; Close-packed along the leaden thread of the stream
the evergreen forests stood like spell-struck hosts in a mystic
communion of silence.&nbsp; Beyond the creek the frowning black
cliffs of the Cup of Nannabijou rose into dizzy space like
impregnable walls and battlements of a giant&rsquo;s
castle.&nbsp; Nowhere in the semicircle of those cliffs could
Hammond discern sign of a draw or even a path that a goat could
climb.</p>
<p>The pair traversed the valley and crossed the creek over a
bridge built of unbarked cedar logs.&nbsp; At the base of the
cliffs the trail turned sharply to the left and followed the
course of the creek upwards for about an eighth of a mile.&nbsp;
There it again swung through the thick-grown green stuff, this
time to the right, disclosing a hidden draw in the cliffs.&nbsp;
They could no longer see the creek, but they could hear its
murmur somewhere to their left.</p>
<p>Suddenly out of the sunlit upper air there came a sullen
rumble of thunder that died away in the most sinister of
echoes.&nbsp; The girl clutched Hammond&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am really getting frightened,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s only an echo of sound waves caught
from dear knows where in this chasm,&rdquo; he assured her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This no doubt is the entrance to the Cup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pushed on, up and up.&nbsp; Though fairly steep the trail
was well-worn and clean-going.&nbsp; Soon they found themselves
out of the woods but shut in by high rock walls.&nbsp; The aisle
through the living rock finally ended abruptly, but to their left
yawned the opening of a man-high tunnel along which the trail
apparently continued.&nbsp; From out of this came the low thunder
of waterfalls and the swishing purl and splash of rapids.</p>
<p>Then, above them this time it seemed, they heard the <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>melodious
alarum of the mysterious gong.&nbsp; The rumble of rapids grew
fainter and fainter and finally almost died away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we should go on?&rdquo; the girl asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the edge of the creek anyway,&rdquo;
he suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;It must be at the other end of this
tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josephine Stone looked up the towering black walls that hemmed
them in like a prison.&nbsp; &ldquo;It makes one think,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;that there might be something in the Indian
superstition that an awful spirit presides in these
cliffs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to that,&rdquo; laughed Hammond, &ldquo;but the
fruit of poor Lo&rsquo;s untutored mind and his over-active
imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this carefree young man little dreamed of the grim
guardian of the way to the Cup which kept inviolable the secrets
beyond the cliffs&mdash;a white monster, which, once unleashed,
could not be recalled by its masters till it had wreaked its will
to destroy.</p>
<p>They were both soon to learn something of it in a manner most
startling.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>The tunnel, as Hammond had conceived, was short.&nbsp; Its
sepulchral gloom ended on open air at the very edge of what
seemed to have been the bed of a mountain torrent, and, though
only the tiniest of streams trickled down the centre of it, its
sides were glistening with moisture as though swept very recently
by rushing waters.&nbsp; On the further side rose an unbroken
wall of rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t venture any further, Mr.
Hammond,&rdquo; pleaded Josephine Stone tremulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-day,&rdquo; agreed Hammond, &ldquo;but I just
want to drop down and have a look up this stream-bed.&nbsp;
Unless <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>I
miss my guess it is the pass that leads into the Cup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suiting action to his words, he let himself down to the first
of a series of natural stone steps on the side of the
stream-bed.</p>
<p>His foot no sooner touched the step than the tunnel back of
them was flooded with a wicked green flash, blinding in its
intensity.&nbsp; Simultaneously, from above, in the towering
cliffs of Nannabijou came a single reverberating, gonglike
note.&nbsp; Followed a low, vibrating rumble which merged into a
thunderous roaring and crashing increasing every second in volume
as if the whole mountainside were tumbling down upon them.</p>
<p>Hammond felt the girl grip convulsively at his coat sleeve as
she cried out.&nbsp; He drew back into the tunnel.</p>
<p>There was a hiss and whine of flying rock particles; then a
raging, white-foaming flood, filling the stream-bed almost to its
brim, swept by like a monster thing of life.&nbsp; The empty,
silent channel was transformed in the twinkling of an eye into a
mountain torrent, absolutely impassable, ready to hurl to death
any living thing in its path.</p>
<p>The way to the Cup of Nannabijou had been effectually
sealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; cried the girl, &ldquo;let us leave this
terrible place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond sprang to her side and they hurried out through the
tunnel and down through the pass in the rock to the trail in the
woods.&nbsp; Not until they had crossed the bridge over the creek
did Josephine Stone pause to speak.&nbsp; Her face was pale and
Hammond noted with alarm she was all a-tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that rushing water!&rdquo;&nbsp; She gasped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The lightning&mdash;and that man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t see him.&nbsp; But I
did&mdash;his face at the other end of the tunnel&mdash;in the
lightning flash.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>&ldquo;What did he look like?&nbsp; Where did he
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was an Indian&mdash;he seemed to fade out of sight
like a spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There flashed on Hammond memory of what Sandy Macdougal had
told him about an Indian shadowing him, but he said lightly:
&ldquo;Likely some idle Indian following us out of
curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josephine Stone shook her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is
something wicked and mysterious about the Cup of
Nannabijou,&rdquo; she contended.&nbsp; &ldquo;They say men have
gone up there and never been seen again.&nbsp; I should not have
let you attempt to get down into that stream-bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have had a narrow squeak if I had attempted it
a minute or so sooner,&rdquo; he reflected.&nbsp; Then: &ldquo;By
the way, if I may ask, how long do you expect to remain at
Amethyst Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can hardly say&mdash;it all
depends.&rdquo;&nbsp; She hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;It may be a
couple of weeks and it may be more, but I hope to get away before
the bitter weather sets in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face had suddenly become grave.&nbsp; He could sense that
allusion to her business in this wild part of Canada, whatever it
might be, distressed her, so he dropped the subject for less
personal matters.</p>
<p>When they finally came out upon the lakeshore at the foot of
the trail the girl stayed him with a hand upon his arm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is where we must part to-day,&rdquo; she said looking
anxiously along the beach.</p>
<p>He did not question her evident haste to leave him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When may I come again?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time.&rdquo;&nbsp; Softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-morrow,
if it&rsquo;s nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was standing with her little white hand extended.&nbsp; He
looked down into those wondrous blue orbs with their warm
light&mdash;and was lost.&nbsp; His right hand closed over her
fingers and his left went about her little shoulders and swept
her to him.</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>&ldquo;Josephine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gasped frightenedly, suppressing a startled cry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not yet&mdash;not here,&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was unfair of me,&rdquo; he started to say, but he
did not release her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you&mdash;you hurry.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
significance of her low whisper was tantalising.</p>
<p>His arms closed her to him.&nbsp; This time her face rose to
his, the long, silky lashes drooping under those divinely arched
brows.&nbsp; His lips found the warm, velvety caress of
hers.&nbsp; He felt her tremble like a prisoned bird in his
arms.</p>
<p>There came to them the sound of footfalls and a rasping of
steel boot-hobs on the rock up the trail.&nbsp; The girl pressed
him from her, wide, genuine alarm in her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
must go&mdash;quickly,&rdquo; she urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then until we meet
again&mdash;Josephine&mdash;good-bye,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye&mdash;Louis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung off along the lakeshore trail.&nbsp; But at a sound
he stopped in the screen of evergreens.</p>
<p>The low-hanging branches of the balsams parted at the mouth of
the other trail and a great figure of a man, immaculate,
faultless in his tartan mackinaw, corduroy riding breeches and
knee-high white elk bush boots, stepped out upon the sands of the
beach.</p>
<p>The newcomer doffed his soft narrow-brimmed stetson hat with
the grace and courtliness of a knight of old.&nbsp; Acey
Smith!</p>
<p>The deviltry that invariably lurked about the
lumber-man&rsquo;s pale, handsome face was masked in the blandest
of smiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Miss Stone.&rdquo;&nbsp; His greeting had
a low, rich quality of music in it that bespoke the cultured
gentleman Hammond conceived him not to be.&nbsp; The <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>magical
effect of his presence on the young woman gave Hammond his first
poignant twinge of jealousy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I did not keep you waiting long,&rdquo; she
offered, going forward to meet him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was away for a
long walk this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up the hill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>His face grew grave.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought I told you you
must not go up the hill alone,&rdquo; he chided.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I wasn&rsquo;t alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; She paused,
but his face gave no inkling of surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only I
over-stayed my time and I was afraid I kept you
waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t in the least inconvenienced,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall we go down to your favourite seat
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tripped to his side and they sauntered along the beach
toward Amethyst Island.</p>
<p>It was quite beneath Louis Hammond to play the part of
eavesdropper, though a curiosity akin to jealousy as to what the
Big Boss of the Nannabijou Camps and Josephine Stone could have
in common was fairly burning him up.&nbsp; He swung resolutely
away in the opposite direction&mdash;for the camp.</p>
<p>His thoughts were in a mighty whirl.&nbsp; But withal they
were pleasant thoughts&mdash;deliriously pleasant.</p>
<p>He had held in his arms Josephine Stone, she whom he had
dreamed of so long as the Girl with the High-arched
Eyebrows&mdash;had kissed her&mdash;yes, had been kissed by her
in return.&nbsp; Hammond was astounded over his own enterprise as
a lover.</p>
<p>When such a woman suffered a man to kiss her on the mouth, he
swore to himself, she must&mdash;must hold him in a regard higher
than any other man.&nbsp; It therefore did not matter about Acey
Smith.</p>
<p>Such a woman he could trust!</p>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>But
had Hammond been a witness to what took place on the beach after
he left he assuredly would not have been so easy of mind.&nbsp;
He might have been turned white-hot with jealousy.</p>
<p>Or, being the sound philosopher that he was, in spite of his
youth, he might have reasoned that under stress of certain
circumstances the best of women will do strange things.</p>

119</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
CAPTAIN CARLSTONE, V. C.</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Josephine Stone</span> did not look back
after Acey Smith led her down the lakeshore from the spot where
she had parted with Louis Hammond.&nbsp; She knew Hammond would
neither attempt to follow them nor spy upon them from a
distance.&nbsp; Perhaps too she was preoccupied with the tensity
of new sensations she did not quite understand.&nbsp; Had she
been inclined to mental analysis she might have contrasted the
reactions upon herself the presence of the two men brought about;
the one frank, buoyant, purposeful and full of the verve and
enthusiasm of youth&mdash;the other in the prime of his vigour;
masterful, grimly fascinating under his cloak of mystery and
conscious power.</p>
<p>What discerning, womanly woman is not drawn irresistibly by
the type of men who curb tremendous potentialities under a poise
that outwardly bespeaks merely good form and the niceties of the
occasion?&nbsp; It was not &ldquo;side&rdquo; with this man; it
was patent he was what he was for a definite purpose.&nbsp; More,
to the sensitive intuition of Josephine Stone there appealed from
out of the deeps of the personality of Acey Smith a great latent
tragedy&mdash;a something persistently repressed by that
fatalistic mouth that could set so grim and straight&mdash;a
something that smouldered at times in his brooding eyes and
flickered ever so elusively over the face he had taught to be a
cold, cruel mask.</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>If
she did not analyse, she at least felt these things in her
feminine way.&nbsp; It was this impression, perhaps, that
impelled her to say as they strolled to the log seat by the
whispering surf: &ldquo;Sometimes, Mr. Smith, this place seems to
me like an enchanted forest&mdash;like a dream inset in the
prosaic course of everyday life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it appeal to you that way, Miss
Stone?&rdquo;&nbsp; He led her to the log seat and dropped down
near her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Strange, isn&rsquo;t it, how some
life-incidents flicker by us with all the glamour of a
dream&mdash;leaving us wondering, in a floundering sort of way,
if it wasn&rsquo;t a fleeting mirage, so to speak, from some
other existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You express it so wonderfully!&nbsp; You think then
that all of us have experienced previous existences on this or
some other sphere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of us&mdash;perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have felt <i>that</i> here then, the same as
I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have.&rdquo;&nbsp; Acey Smith lit a cigarette.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You may laugh at the conceit, but at times I could fancy
the feel of a basket sword-hilt at my side, the rap-rap of its
scabbard-end on my heels and even the jingle of spurs on my
boots.&nbsp; Yet, what I believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off and laughed scornfully at his own
confession.&nbsp; &ldquo;What nonsense to be boring you with,
Miss Stone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not nonsense, and you&rsquo;re not
boring me.&nbsp; You must go on,&rdquo; she commanded,
&ldquo;even if I have to first confess that I have heard the
clanking of your knightly sword, the jingling of your
spurs&mdash;yes, and even felt at my cheek for the beauty-patch I
fancied was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His glance met hers, swiftly.&nbsp; If she were merely acting
she was intense about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to say that what I believe is that it is a
fleeting glimpse of the ideal we experience at such times, and
imagination does the rest,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp; <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>&ldquo;Most
of us are composites of two or more personalities.&nbsp; Fate, or
circumstances if you prefer, decrees which of those personalities
shall flourish; the others, like the sucker-shoots of yonder
mountain ash tree, aspire but never attain perfection.&nbsp;
There is always the Man That Is and the Man That Might Have
Been.&nbsp; Saint or sinner, philosopher or fool, there comes
sooner or later a time when the Man That Might Have Been insists
on life and triumph for his little day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But doesn&rsquo;t the choice of personality lie pretty
much with the man himself?&rdquo; she argued.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know they say that every man is the architect of his own
fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strong men are ever the playthings of Destiny,&rdquo;
he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;So-called masterful men stifle their
true selves and accept the role that Fate has ordained alone
shall carry them to their goal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cynicism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must the truth always be sugar-coated?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
an impression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak out of an experience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More or less.&rdquo;&nbsp; Frankly.</p>
<p>Josephine Stone plunged boldly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then, for
instance,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;the man they call Acey
Smith might have been whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite another personality by quite another
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe there is something in a name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do and I do not, Miss Cross-examiner,&rdquo; he
answered enigmatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Napoleon might have been
born Dick Jones, but in such a case the world would have found
another name to call him by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed over the allusion.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you are
drifting away from the subject, Mr. Witness,&rdquo; she
reminded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I asked you about Acey Smith&rsquo;s Man
That Might Have Been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a dreamer of high-minded dreams and a <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>scholar;
the man Fate shaped and willed should survive was merely him they
call Acey Smith the timber pirate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this Man That Might Have Been.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
was deep concern in her tones.&nbsp; &ldquo;You could have made
him, and you could yet&mdash;by the sheer force of your
will&mdash;make him a reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His black eyes were drawn to hers, and, momentarily, she
thought she saw the soul of another man&mdash;another who was not
Acey Smith.&nbsp; But the softened light in them as quickly
changed to a hardened glint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said harshly, &ldquo;that man can
never be.&nbsp; I am fighting him off&mdash;have been fighting
him since&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; His gaze swerved from hers as his
jaw clicked the balance: &ldquo;&mdash;since you came.&nbsp; His
advent now&mdash;would mean disaster.&nbsp; I found him too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anything she might have added was negatived by his changed
attitude, a field of reserve, of isolation, he threw around
himself at will.&nbsp; &ldquo;With your permission,&rdquo; he
urged, &ldquo;we will drop the personal topic with which I have
been egotistically monopolising your time.&nbsp; You intimated at
our last meeting that you had finally decided to tell me why it
was so essential you should meet J.C.X.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I
told you there was a very personal matter concerned outside of
the unexplained reason for the head of the North Star Company
asking me to come here.&nbsp; It was this: A man known as J.C.X.
knew something of the affairs of my grandfather, Joseph Stone, a
mining prospector, who lived and died in this north country
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you knew of the existence of J.C.X. before you
received his letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, through the rather vague statements about J.C.X.,
the North Star Company and my grandfather made in a field
hospital during the great war by a <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Canadian named Captain Carlstone
while in a delirium caused by shell-shock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;&nbsp; If there was a shock of surprise in
this disclosure, Acey Smith&rsquo;s features did not register
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest was all conjecture,&rdquo; Josephine Stone
went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;But let me first tell you the story of
Captain Carlstone.&nbsp; When you have heard it you will be the
better able to understand my curiosity in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a long story,&rdquo; she began.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The military career of Captain Carlstone was
meteoric&mdash;he flashed into the thick of things from nobody
knew where and disappeared in the fog of war as mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was one of the first contingent of nurses who
accompanied the Canadian forces to the front,&rdquo; she
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never had the privilege of meeting the
wonderful captain, but everybody in the &mdash;th division heard
of him and his dare-devil exploits.&nbsp; He was not only noted
for his bravery but for an almost superhuman cunning and
resourcefulness.&nbsp; The men fairly worshipped him.&nbsp; I
nursed wounded soldiers who swore they would cheerfully walk into
the mouth of hell behind Captain Carlstone and declared that to
die fighting by the side of such a man would be the height of
glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With his superior officers, however, he was not so
popular.&nbsp; They were jealous of the handsome, dare-devil
captain, who seemed himself to devise obstacles against further
promotion.&nbsp; At the battle of Vimy Ridge he won the Victoria
Cross, and he might have had higher promotion as well but for a
sarcastic remark made publicly that he valued the companionship
of his boys more than any &lsquo;dug-out office&rsquo; they could
give him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Carlstone was a mystery man whose previous <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>history
none knew beyond the facts that he enlisted in the West early in
the war and won first a promotion from the ranks to lieutenant
and then to captain on the field.&nbsp; He was very
dark-complexioned&mdash;so dark it was generally conceded he had
Indian blood in him or a foreign strain from some remote ancestor
in Canada.&nbsp; Some were inclined to the belief that he was
fighting under an assumed name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Carlstone seemed to bear a charmed life.&nbsp;
He was always where the fighting was heaviest and came out
unscathed until his last memorable engagement, when, with a
picked body of men, he captured a strategic position in a clump
of woods the enemy was holding.&nbsp; He was to have had further
honours for that, but they brought him from the wood in a state
of coma induced by shell-shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was conveyed to a base hospital where he came out of
the stupor a raving maniac.&nbsp; His complete recovery came with
that remarkable suddenness that sometimes characterised such
cases, but the morning following the day he became normal he was
not in his cot.&nbsp; Not a clue to his whereabouts was ever
afterwards discovered.&nbsp; He was one of the unsolved mysteries
of the war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Mr. Smith, we come to the point where I
became so personally interested in locating J.C.X.,&rdquo;
concluded Josephine Stone.&nbsp; &ldquo;While in the base
hospital Captain Carlstone was under the care of an old chum of
mine, Sister Cummings.&nbsp; It was she who afterwards told me of
the vivid story he related during his ravings of the death of
Joseph Stone, my grandfather, on a northern trail years
ago.&nbsp; Alternately, he talked of a mine and a will, most of
it incoherent, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josephine Stone paused.&nbsp; Acey Smith was gazing fixedly
beyond her into the thicket above, but at her <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>cognisance
of it the alertness in his features relaxed in a whimsical smile
and his eyes came back to a level with hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed almost an unbelievable coincidence when I
received the letter signed by J.C.X., asking me to come here to
learn something of interest to myself,&rdquo; continued the
girl.</p>
<p>Again Acey Smith flashed an apprehensive glance at the woods
above.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll go
down to the open space on the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had heard nothing and could discern no sign of life where
his eyes had been focussed.&nbsp; Nevertheless, she accompanied
him without question down the beach out of earshot of the
woods.</p>
<p>He turned to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your grandfather died when you
were a child?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was two years of age, yes.&nbsp; He was by hobby
a scientific man and a recluse, I believe, but he did
considerable prospecting.&nbsp; My father was an only son, and,
after the death of my grandmother, he insisted on father leaving
the wilds.&nbsp; There followed a heated dispute which led my
father to leave never to return.&nbsp; He seldom spoke of
grandfather, and mother and I learned only the most fragmentary
details of him and his life.&nbsp; Father died before I started
to school and mother passed away a few years later, leaving me
quite alone in the world, and had it not been for an invention of
father&rsquo;s, purchased on a royalty basis after his death by a
manufacturing firm, I might also have been left quite
penniless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never learned definitely just what happened your
grandfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; There were rumours reached us that he was
killed by Indians in the bush and that rival prospectors had made
away with him after he had discovered a gold <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>mine.&nbsp;
But none of these stories seemingly were ever confirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my life I&rsquo;ve wanted to learn about
grandfather and what happened him,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Though I had never known him it seemed as though he was
very near to me&mdash;as if actually I had been in his dying
thoughts.&nbsp; I had intended to explain all this to you that
first night I went to your office, but&mdash;I was at
first&mdash;afraid of you.&nbsp; Since then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he urged as she hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;ve felt instinctively you knew what I
came to seek and you would find a way.&nbsp; I know now I could
trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>She looked up at him.&nbsp; His eyes did not meet hers and she
was unprepared for the answer he gave her: &ldquo;If you had
asked sixty people, forty-nine who know me best would have told
you you had better put your trust in Mephistopheles
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught her breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;But that&mdash;that is
because they do not know you intimately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is because they know me <i>too</i>
intimately&mdash;the reputation is not unmerited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a bitter indifference to his words that chilled her,
a drooping sneer at his mouth and a cold gleam in his black eyes
as he made frank, unboastful admission of iniquity.&nbsp; It
seemed for a space as though the demon he had confessed looked
out mockingly from the man at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you made no mistake,&rdquo; he assured her almost
immediately.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your woman&rsquo;s intuition told you
aright; there is that I must assist you to learn of, even
if&mdash;if I did not care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But about Captain Carlstone,&rdquo; she reminded
him.&nbsp; <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>&ldquo;You have not told me whether he has any
connection with the matter or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Carlstone does not matter.&nbsp; He is
gone&mdash;made away with himself somewhere overseas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killed himself?&rdquo; she asked aghast.</p>
<p>Acey Smith gave vent to a soulless, soundless laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; he answered
indifferently.&nbsp; &ldquo;At any rate, he never came back to
Canada.&nbsp; There were vital reasons why he dare not.&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t waste pity on him; as I said, he doesn&rsquo;t
matter, and, lest you may have conceived otherwise, I may tell
you there was never anything in common between Captain Carlstone
and J.C.X.&nbsp; In fact, they were as unalike as it is possible
for two individuals to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His utter callousness bruised the sensitive girl&mdash;angered
her so that she could have wished to have been a man to strike
him where he stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be patient for a little while.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
intercepted the retort that trembled on her lips.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You shall know and you shall understand.&nbsp; You shall
be the first person outside myself to meet face to face the
mysterious J.C.X., whose power is greater than any other one
individual in the Dominion of Canada, who makes and unmakes big
businesses at his will, sways big men as puppets, uses political
parties as pawns to his own advantage, advises and the Press
thunders his words, and yet works as with an unseen hand.&nbsp;
You shall be the first to meet J.C.X. and know definitely in
whose presence you stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I care to meet
him&mdash;now,&rdquo; coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you wanted to know about your
grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean he alone can tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, J.C.X. could tell you nothing of that.&nbsp; But it
is through your coming meeting with him that you will learn all
that you seek to know and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why all this intense mystery about it?&rdquo; <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>Josephine
Stone plucked up courage to demand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I confess I am
at a greater loss now than ever to know what all these
complications mean&mdash;where they lead to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came frank concern into his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only
wish it were in my power to tell you&mdash;now,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it is out of my province to say
more.&nbsp; In a week, or likely less, the appointed time will
arrive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile, I have to go east on urgent business,&rdquo;
he added.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will return as quickly as possible, but
before I go I am going to ask you if you will put yourself in my
care without question as to the reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to leave here&mdash;with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&nbsp; Oh, but you may bring your chaperon,
Mrs. Johnson, with you.&nbsp; It will be all perfectly
proper.&nbsp; Only, I must ask you to leave without notifying a
soul, not even your Indian servants.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a
reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A reason?&nbsp; Another unexplained reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I may tell you this time.&nbsp; I fear for your
safety during the next few days while I am away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you do not sense your
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An enemy?&rdquo; she echoed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one who despatched notes to yourself and young
Hammond to bring about your first meeting here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he urged before the exclamation of
surprise died on her lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say you will go
to-night.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come over in the motorboat this
evening and we can make the arrangements.&nbsp; It is vital that
you should leave here at once and without any one knowing or I
would not ask it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without notifying my friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She read from his keen answering glance that he knew <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>she was
thinking of Hammond.&nbsp; &ldquo;Without notifying any
one,&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I refuse to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is final?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, unless I can be shown a more coherent reason for
going in such a manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The worried look that had come into his face receded and he
laughed a queer, bitter, little laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, well, if
you <i>will</i> have it so, it is up to me to change my
plans,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that being so, I must bid
you good-bye until I return from Montreal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if you should
hear men striking camp up the trail along the lakeshore this
evening don&rsquo;t be alarmed.&nbsp; It will be merely a squad
of the mounted police who&rsquo;ve come to patrol this section of
the waterfront during the strike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike?&rdquo; she echoed perplexed.</p>
<p>He walked up the beach, drew his cached packsack from a clump
of green stuff and returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re to
have one of those modern luxuries in the camp within the next few
days,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>He lifted his hat, whirled on a heel and was away.</p>
<p>In a maze of doubt as to whether her recent refusal to leave
the island as he had requested were a wise decision, she watched
Acey Smith go up and over the first hill of the lakeshore
trail.&nbsp; When his figure had disappeared she was assailed by
a sudden apprehension&mdash;an overwhelming
apprehension&mdash;that she had made a grave mistake.&nbsp; There
must have been deep, very deep reasons for his asking her to
leave the island.&nbsp; No doubt she was imperilling not only her
own safety but his plans as well.</p>
<p>On an impulse she sped forward after him.&nbsp; She felt that
she could easily get within call of him before he <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>reached the
crown of the second hill.&nbsp; In her close-fitting garments she
made fast time, but on the top of the first hill she paused all
out of breath.&nbsp; The trail before her down through the valley
and up the further rise was silent and empty.</p>
<p>At a tramping sound in the brush to her left she hesitated
about proceeding.&nbsp; It might be a wandering bear or
moose.</p>
<p>The bushes up the trail parted and a fearsome figure strode
out&mdash;a figure as forbidding as one might well conceive an
evil spirit to be.&nbsp; His face was almost black and on his
cheek-bones stood out two livid red gashes.&nbsp; He wore no
head-covering save a band of purple which held a single
eagle&rsquo;s feather in place in his lank, black hair.&nbsp;
Round his neck were hung string upon string of gleaming white
wolves&rsquo; teeth.</p>
<p>At the girl&rsquo;s involuntary cry of dismay he whirled, the
whites of his evil black eyes showing garishly in his satanic
visage.&nbsp; It afterwards recurred to her that he had at first
appeared quite as startled as she had been, but he almost
immediately straightened, and, folding his arms on his chest,
pronounced himself in deep, strangely-vibrating guttural
tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ogima Bush,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;big Medicine
Man.&nbsp; Him no hurt white lady.&nbsp;
<i>Un-n-n-n</i>&mdash;white lady pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Josephine Stone waited to have no further parley.&nbsp;
She turned and fled on trembling limbs back toward the
island.&nbsp; And, as she ran, there fell upon her ears a
penetrating, wailing cry, long-drawn-out and blood-curdling in
its mixture of mockery and despair&mdash;a cry that for
subsequent reasons she was destined to remember all the days of
her life.</p>
<h2><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>CHAPTER XII<br />
&ldquo;WHEN ALL THE WORLD IS YOUNG, LAD!&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Louis Hammond</span> returned to the camp
that morning after he had parted with Josephine Stone down on the
beach near Amethyst Island in a seventh heaven of ecstatic
speculation.&nbsp; It was his first genuine love affair.&nbsp;
The thrill of having held the svelte, firm form of that lovely
creature yielding in the embrace of his arms was still upon
him.&nbsp; He had discovered a new world&mdash;mating
youth&rsquo;s own wonder world, where the blue sky, the waving
trees and the dancing water take on a new significance and seem
to weave out of a sympathetic gladness the song of Eden&rsquo;s
first splendrous dawn.&nbsp; Ah, the magic and the poetry that
come with the first sweep of Cupid&rsquo;s wand in the early
flush of manhood. . . .&nbsp; Youth that has yet to encounter it
dreams not of the completeness of its power. . . .&nbsp; Middle
life sighs for the dream that has vanished. . . .&nbsp; Age
secretly revels in its memory as a miser gloats over his hoarded
treasure.&nbsp; If, as the glum-faced realists tell us, it is all
illusion&mdash;then, let Illusion reign!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;When all the world is young, lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And every field is green;<br />
And every goose a swan, lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And every lass a queen,<br />
Then hey for boot and horse, lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And round the world away;<br />
Young blood must have its course, lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And every dog his day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>Already young Hammond was looking forward to their next
meeting&mdash;the very next morning, in fact, he planned to again
saunter down to Amethyst Island on a chance of gaining a few
hours of her exquisite society.&nbsp; She&mdash;she must be his
own completely.</p>
<p>But always our profoundest dreams are ephemeral when grim
Reality stalks in the background.&nbsp; Later, the natural law of
moods brought to Hammond the inevitable reaction.&nbsp; He was
smitten with a sense of duty unperformed.&nbsp; He could not
exactly define it, but he had a feeling of uselessness, a vague
notion that he was drifting nowhere.&nbsp; What indeed had a man,
situated as he was at present, to offer a girl of Josephine
Stone&rsquo;s evident refinement and high aspirations?&nbsp; So
far as appearances were concerned he was nothing more than a
vagrant biding his time on the pulp limits at the whim of a man
who had dropped out of sight.</p>
<p>An inner voice demanded he should make a herculean effort to
find his bearings at once.&nbsp; So far as he was concerned,
things had drifted as long as he intended to allow them.</p>
<p>He must work out a plan of action&mdash;must find the answer
to the conflicting incidents of the past few weeks and meanwhile
secure real and useful employment.&nbsp; He had it!&nbsp; No
doubt the officials in charge of the Kam City Company&rsquo;s
pulp mill would instal him in the position Norman T. Gildersleeve
had promised him that night on the train.&nbsp; First, he must
find a means of getting to the city.&nbsp; It should not be a
very difficult feat to steal aboard one of the outgoing
tugs.&nbsp; Yet, if he did succeed in doing that very thing, what
might be the possibilities of his getting back to see Josephine
Stone?&nbsp; What if she should stand in need of his help and
protection?</p>
<p>Hammond was on the horns of a dilemma, with the <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>problem
ever recurring to him: What was Josephine Stone doing here, and
what could there be in common between her and the pulp camp
superintendent?</p>
<p>The road to a mental solution of these questions proved as
baffling as an attempt to find the reason for the numerous weird
experiences he had gone through since the night he had made the
deal with Norman T. Gildersleeve.&nbsp; All those circumstances,
he conceived, had been too remarkable to be the result of mere
accident.&nbsp; Human ingenuity was somewhere at work with its
own ends in view, and, back of it all, Hammond was convinced, a
sinister drama was being woven into the texture of affairs with a
design of bringing some terrific climax about.&nbsp; All these
apparent things must be the by-play of hidden plot and
counter-plot.</p>
<p>However, what was the use of trying to analyse situations that
seemed to lead nowhere?&nbsp; Hammond wanted action&mdash;and, he
was <i>going to have it</i>. . . .&nbsp; He would wait till
to-morrow, see Josephine Stone in the morning and find out
definitely if she felt quite sure of her own safety in this wild
place.&nbsp; Then, if everything appealed to him as well, he
would stow away on the tug for town in the afternoon.&nbsp; Once
off the tug at Kam City he would be a free citizen and he could
make a trip back to Amethyst Island at his pleasure in a
motorboat.</p>
<p>But the way was made easier for Hammond to reach Kam City than
he for the moment hoped, with subsequent events seemingly gauged
for his further bewilderment.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Coming in from a stroll in the bush in the late afternoon,
Hammond was considerably surprised to discover patrols of the
Canadian Mounted Police pacing the waterfront.&nbsp; Being
hungry, he went direct to the dining-camp, <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>expecting
to learn from Sandy Macdougal, the cook, just what new crisis had
arisen necessitating the presence of the police.</p>
<p>But he had finished the meal before the head cook came
striding in.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say, Hammond,&rdquo; he opened,
&ldquo;the Big Boss told me to tell you he wanted to see you at
his office as soon as you came in.&nbsp; Must be something
all-fired important, for he seemed to be fussy about it, which is
odd for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond hurried over.&nbsp; The interview was short.&nbsp; The
superintendent handed him an envelope bearing his name in firm
spencerian handwriting.&nbsp; &ldquo;It contains a personal pass
on any of the North Star tugs for the season,&rdquo; he
announced.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are at liberty now to use it at your
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger man concealed his amazement in a quiet
&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better take the first tug in the morning,&rdquo;
suggested Acey Smith.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a possibility of
the afternoon tugs being off the run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, the following day will do as well,&rdquo;
returned the elated Hammond.&nbsp; &ldquo;My business in the city
is not so pressing that a day&rsquo;s delay will
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superintendent passed Hammond his cigarette case and lit a
cigarette himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d take the early tug
to-morrow if I were you,&rdquo; he insisted quietly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no telling what may happen the tug service
between here and the city after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not thinking of laying up the
boats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;<i>not</i> us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Smith studied
Hammond idly, a curious, not unfriendly frown puckering his brows
as he added: &ldquo;Playing Sir Galahad seems to impair a
journalist&rsquo;s nose for news, doesn&rsquo;t it,
Hammond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That shot went home under the skin, but before Hammond could
frame a rejoinder Acey Smith spoke up again.&nbsp; <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>&ldquo;I
was going to say,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;that should the tugs
not be running when you are ready to return from the city that
pass will be good on any make-shift service the company
inaugurates to take the place of the big boats.&nbsp;
Incidentally, I am leaving myself to-morrow on a trip to
Montreal, and I&rsquo;ll not be returning to camp for several
days or perhaps a week.&nbsp; For the meantime, I have instructed
Mr. Mooney, the assistant superintendent, to take care of your
wants while our guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond was somewhat nettled by all this new show of attention
and hospitality.&nbsp; He felt like telling the pulp camp
superintendent to go to the devil, but he said
&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; again instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just a minute, Hammond!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond paused at the door as Acey Smith strode over and
passed him a newspaper.&nbsp; &ldquo;The morning edition of the
<i>Star</i>,&rdquo; he indicated.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is an item
on the front page that may interest
you&mdash;considerably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wispy, mocking light that came over Acey Smith&rsquo;s
face when he uttered that last word was lost on Hammond for the
moment.&nbsp; He walked back to his quarters in a fighting mood,
all the more poignant because he had had to suppress it.&nbsp;
Smith seemed to take such a fiendish enjoyment out of making him
feel like a child he was studying for the sheer fun of the
thing.&nbsp; Too, Hammond&rsquo;s professional pride had been
stung by the other&rsquo;s broad insinuation that he, for a
newspaper man, was wofully asleep to what was going on around
him.&nbsp; It had gone the deeper because it was coupled with
that vague hint about his attentions to Josephine Stone&mdash;at
least that was what Hammond had taken the reference to Sir
Galahad to mean.</p>
<p>What was going on at the limits?&nbsp; Why were all these
mounted police out here?&nbsp; Why did the workmen, muttering in
groups, fall so silent when he came near?&nbsp; <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>Undoubtedly, a crisis of some sort was near at hand and
he <i>had</i> missed a big piece of news that was breaking right
under his nose.&nbsp; He began to concede to himself that he was
deserving of the keenest of Acey Smith&rsquo;s sarcasm.&nbsp; He
had needed something like that to bring him down out of the
clouds.</p>
<p>At first he was for going down and striking up a conversation
with some of the police.&nbsp; On second thought he
didn&rsquo;t&mdash;he knew from experience how absolutely
close-mouthed Canadian mounted policemen were about their
orders.&nbsp; There was little that Sandy Macdougal would not
know; he&rsquo;d ask Sandy first.</p>
<p>But Sandy hadn&rsquo;t come over from the cook camp when
Hammond entered their shack.&nbsp; He had built up the fire in
the little heater and lit his pipe when he bethought him of the
<i>Star</i> that Acey Smith had passed him.</p>
<p>Under the wall lamp Hammond spread out the paper, then he
jumped to his feet as his eyes were caught by a lower corner
scare-line heading:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><b>POLICE LOOKING FOR
YOUNG STRANGER</b><br />
<b>SEEN WITH N. T. GILDERSLEEVE BEFORE</b><br />
<b>MILLIONAIRE DISAPPEARED FROM TRAIN</b></p>
<p>Unknown Youth Travelling Alone Was in Pulp Magnate&rsquo;s
Stateroom, Coloured Porter Tells Authorities&mdash;Suspicion of
Foul Play?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Mysterious Note Delivered En
Route</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the body of the article Hammond read a badly-garbled
description of himself and an equally highly-elaborated story of
his interview with Gildersleeve.&nbsp; The coloured
porter&rsquo;s powers of imagination were in excellent working
order, for he told of a loud altercation going on inside the
stateroom before he entered, and that both <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>men were
standing glaring at each other with drawn, white faces when he
was admitted.</p>
<p>It was all very ridiculous to one on the inside as to what
really had happened, but quite on a par with most of the wild
raft of useless clues brought to the surface by the police
dragnet in mystery cases.&nbsp; Hammond might have laughed
outright but for another thought that occurred to him.</p>
<p>He was under suspicion of having something to do with
Gildersleeve&rsquo;s disappearance!</p>
<p>So this was why Acey Smith had so suddenly become liberal with
a pass over on the tug!&nbsp; The minute Hammond touched foot on
Kam City docks he was very liable to be arrested and thrown into
jail on suspicion of being concerned in a plot to do away with
Gildersleeve.&nbsp; He would afterwards have to go through one of
those small town police &ldquo;third degrees,&rdquo; usually more
brutal and stupid than they were effective.</p>
<p>Smith had known that before he made out the pass&mdash;then he
had given him the paper with this news in it so that he&rsquo;d
see how dangerous it would be for him to attempt to visit Kam
City just now.</p>
<p>It was a proof of the superintendent&rsquo;s fiendish notion
of what constituted a good joke&mdash;but no, that couldn&rsquo;t
be it.&nbsp; Smith had been too insistent on Hammond&rsquo;s
taking the early tug.&nbsp; Acey Smith was too keen a reader of
character to doubt that he, Hammond, would face the music rather
than skulk around the pulp camp a fugitive from justice.&nbsp;
Smith had some other motive, thought Hammond&mdash;there was no
doubt about that now.&nbsp; Despite his obvious iniquity, there
was a strong element of Canadian sportsmanship in Acey
Smith&rsquo;s make-up, Hammond had seen proofs of that.&nbsp;
More likely he took this off-hand method of warning Hammond what
he&rsquo;d be up against when he landed in Kam City.&nbsp; That
was more <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>like Acey Smith whom most men feared, others hated and
few could find it in their hearts to exactly detest. . . .&nbsp;
More, if the superintendent had merely wanted to complicate
matters for Hammond he would only have had to send word to Kam
City that he, Hammond, was over at the limits, and the
authorities would come after him.&nbsp; Piecing it all together,
the young man now sensed that for some deeper reason the Big Boss
of the timber limits was anxious to see him go over to Kam
City.</p>
<p>But, be that as it might be, Hammond&rsquo;s mind was fully
made up.&nbsp; He was now more determined than ever to make the
trip to Kam City on the morrow.&nbsp; He quite realised what an
ugly position he might be placed in through the erratic evidence
of the coloured porter, but he was chafing to have the whole
thing over with.&nbsp; He could stand continued inaction no
longer.&nbsp; If the police arrested him, well and good:
he&rsquo;d take a chance on the trend of events and his own
evidence bringing the truth to the surface.&nbsp; True, his
contract with Norman T. Gildersleeve called for his keeping
secret the fact that he had been engaged by the millionaire to
stay on the Nannabijou limits until he received other
instructions, but Gildersleeve must truly have disappeared or he
would take steps of some sort or other to prevent Hammond&rsquo;s
arrest on a false charge.&nbsp; He could find no conscientious
reason why he should hold out longer.</p>
<p>He glanced at his watch.&nbsp; It was nearly ten
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He decided not to wait up for Sandy
Macdougal, for he would have to arise early to catch the morning
tug.&nbsp; To-morrow surely would be an eventful day.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Hammond was partially awakened by the cook prowling around
with his bottle and a metal cup.&nbsp; Hammond <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>declined
Sandy&rsquo;s invitation to join him in a &ldquo;night-cap&rdquo;
and turned over to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard the big news, Hammond?&rdquo; the cook asked.</p>
<p>Hammond rolled over again under the blankets at that.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, Sandy,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
being pulled off on the limits anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macdougal tossed down his &ldquo;three fingers&rdquo; and
gazed meaningly at the rusty stove-pipe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be something drop around this
layout before many days are over,&rdquo; he said finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; encouraged Hammond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll keep anything I tell you under your
hat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, if you say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike and blue hell to pay,&rdquo; informed the cook
solemnly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whole caboodle will throw down
tools&mdash;tugmen, waterfront men, pole-cutters and
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, so that&rsquo;s it&mdash;that&rsquo;s why
the mounted police are over here,&rdquo; reflected Hammond.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the grievance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More pay and shorter hours.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t that what
they always say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought the North Star Company were always ready
to consider the demands of the men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they will this time,&rdquo; replied Macdougal,
&ldquo;but I got a hunch they won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
something phony about this whole business.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve
let a whole flock of bolsheviks and O.B.U. agitators into the
camps and never even tried to stop them holdin&rsquo; meetings,
and the foremen have been bullin&rsquo; the men the past few days
just as if they wanted to egg them on.&nbsp; Besides I mistrust
that faraway glint in Acey Smith&rsquo;s wicked eyes these
days.&nbsp; Whenever you see the Big Boss goin&rsquo; around like
as if he was in a trance and he looks at you with that queer
little devil-grin playin&rsquo; at the corners of his mouth
there&rsquo;s new hellery on foot, you can bank on
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>&ldquo;Then you think the North Star&rsquo;s out to
break the strike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Macdougal was rapidly
divesting himself of mackinaw and shoepacks, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;ve a hunch Acey Smith has the dope from the higher-ups
and that it ain&rsquo;t for a settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having so pronounced himself, the cook blew out the light and
plunged into his bunk.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>Hammond awoke to find the little shack flooded with
daylight.&nbsp; That meant that it was late&mdash;much too late
to catch the morning tug.&nbsp; He had neglected to tell Sandy
Macdougal to call him, and he was not by nature an early
riser.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if he acknowledged the truth to himself, he was
not as disappointed about it as he should have been under the
circumstances.&nbsp; There would surely be another tug in to-day,
he reflected&mdash;and the delay would give him an opportunity to
slip over to Amethyst Island before he left.</p>
<p>After breakfast, he set out along the lakeshore trail in high
spirits.&nbsp; At the bridge over the Nannabijou River he was
brought up short by a mountie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me see your
pass,&rdquo; requested the young man in uniform.</p>
<p>Hammond had to acknowledge that he hadn&rsquo;t any, that he
hadn&rsquo;t known one was necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry then,&rdquo; politely informed the policeman,
&ldquo;but the waterfront beyond here is out of bounds for any
one not holding a pass signed by Inspector Little and the camp
superintendent.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considerably abashed, Hammond struck back for the camp.&nbsp;
He would try Acey Smith for a waterfront pass.&nbsp; Likely, in
view of the superintendent&rsquo;s previous anxiety <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>to have him
leave on the early boat, he would be refused point-blank, but it
was worth finding out.</p>
<p>He turned at a shrill tooting out beyond the field of boomed
pulpwood.&nbsp; A tug was just coming in the gap.&nbsp; They must
be running wild to-day&mdash;and perhaps this would be the last
one in before the strike was called.&nbsp; He had better take it
over to Kam City, he reflected.</p>
<p>The tug had docked when Hammond reached the camp&rsquo;s
&ldquo;main street,&rdquo; and he noted that along with a number
of questionable-looking men in city garb the dark-eyed girl in
the sable furs, known as Yvonne, descended the gang-plank.&nbsp;
Acey Smith was not in his office nor anywhere about the
docks.</p>
<p>Two members of the mounted force examined the passes of the
passengers as they came off the dock.&nbsp; The men dispersed
into the upper reaches of the camp, while the girl paused to talk
to a tall, black-whiskered man in an over-long rusty black coat
who went down to meet her.</p>
<p>Hammond was sure he saw first impatience then anger come into
Yvonne&rsquo;s dark face as the Rev. Nathan Stubbs conversed with
her in guarded undertones.&nbsp; Suddenly she swept away from him
with a stamp of her little foot and went direct to the office of
Acey Smith, where she entered without rapping.</p>
<p>The tug took off little freight and took on less.&nbsp; Its
whistle gave a sharp warning blast.</p>
<p>Hammond raced down to the dock.&nbsp; The deck-hands were
actually pulling up the gang-plank and unsnubbing the
hawsers.</p>
<p>He held out his pass for the mounties to see as he went by,
conscious that some one was racing at his heels.&nbsp; A strong
hand reached out and clutched at his shoulder, and he flung it
off unceremoniously.&nbsp; The gang-plank was up, but he cleared
the space between the edge of the dock and the tug&rsquo;s low
deck in a flying leap.</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>He
turned to see the Rev. Nathan Stubbs being unceremoniously yanked
back off the dock by policemen as he continued to gesticulate in
a wild, appealing fashion at Hammond.</p>

143</span>CHAPTER XIII<br />
&ldquo;THEM WAS ROARING DAYS!&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the tug swung out with a great
churning astern, Hammond caught the eye of the skipper looking
out of the wheel-house above.&nbsp; Chuckling over the antics of
the chagrined camp preacher, he jerked his head for Hammond to
come up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a seat.&rdquo;&nbsp; The genial-faced captain
motioned Hammond to the cushioned bench at the back of the tiny
wheel-house.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sky-pilot seemed to be all fussed
up about something, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Hammond.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m at
a loss to know what came over him all of a sudden.&nbsp; As a
rule he never appeared to notice I existed around the
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess he&rsquo;s harmless, from what I
hear,&rdquo; agreed the captain, &ldquo;but you can never tell
just what&rsquo;s what about some of these queer birds they let
hang around that camp.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s that old Medicine Man,
for instance, I wouldn&rsquo;t trust my back to him two minutes
in the bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ogima Bush?&nbsp; You think he&rsquo;s
dangerous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The skipper yanked at the lever of the steam steering-gear and
swung the tug due west outside the channel through the pulp
booms.&nbsp; &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t any bully in the camp will
take chances on crossing him,&rdquo; he said significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think the superintendent would have him run
off the limits.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>&ldquo;He daren&rsquo;t, even if he wanted to,&rdquo;
declared the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s long odds that old
crock is cahoots with the Big Boss.&nbsp; At least
everybody&rsquo;s got that notion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak of the devil,&rdquo; he exclaimed next minute,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s the Big Boss heading for camp
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond leaped to his feet and looked where the captain was
pointing.&nbsp; Sure enough he could discern the
superintendent&rsquo;s red racing motorboat tearing over the
water from a point the other side of Amethyst Island, bow up in
air with a crash of foam under its midships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try the glasses,&rdquo; suggested the captain.&nbsp;
Hammond fitted them to his eyes and adjusted the lenses.&nbsp;
Acey Smith, at the wheel, was the only occupant of the tiny
cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smith talked of going over to Kam City this
afternoon,&rdquo; suggested Hammond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he told me yesterday he was in a hurry to get
things cleaned up so he could get away in time,&rdquo; replied
the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;He intended to catch the night train for
Montreal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you know there&rsquo;s trouble on among the
tug-men?&rdquo; he queried turning from the steering-lever a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if the tugmen go out it means the pole-cutters
and the white boom-tenders at the limits will down tools in
sympathy tying everything up as tight as a river-jam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely Smith&rsquo;s going to Montreal to talk it over
with some of the heads of the company, eh?&rdquo;&nbsp; Hammond
was sparring for more information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno.&rdquo;&nbsp; There came a faraway look in the
captain&rsquo;s blue eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hon. J. J. Slack, of Kam
City, is supposed to be top dog of this outfit, and then again
some think he&rsquo;s only a straw boss.&nbsp; But if you asked a
lot of <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>people they&rsquo;d tell you the real head push of this
outfit hangs out in a place that&rsquo;s a lot hotter than
Montreal or Kam City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond was scarcely paying any attention to the
captain&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; He had the glasses trained on
Amethyst Island which they were now passing.&nbsp; The place had
a deserted look.&nbsp; The doors of Josephine Stone&rsquo;s
cottage were closed and there was not a sign of life on the
island.&nbsp; That seemed queer&mdash;very queer.&nbsp; Perhaps,
he conjectured, she had gone over to their meeting-place on the
beach and was expecting him to happen along.</p>
<p>But he swept the beach with the glasses for a glimpse of her
in vain.&nbsp; Presently, two scarlet-coated policemen emerged
from the bush on the mainland and walked up the rise to a bell
tent that was pitched on the crown of the hill.&nbsp; There one
apparently flung an order to his companion, and the latter set
off at a loping run in the direction of the pulp camp.</p>
<p>A depressing presentiment swept over Hammond.&nbsp; He would
have liked to have asked the captain to turn in and let him off
at Amethyst Island, but he didn&rsquo;t quite dare do that.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>It was the captain who interrupted his reverie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We were talking just now about that camp sky-pilot, the
Rev. Nathan Stubbs,&rdquo; he reminded Hammond.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was saying that Smith lets Ogima Bush the Medicine Man have the
run of the camps because he can use him for his own
purposes.&nbsp; Now it&rsquo;s different with that preacher
fellow; it&rsquo;s always been known that the Big Boss
won&rsquo;t order any kind of a Christian preacher out of camp so
long as the preacher sticks to the gospel and his own particular
line of trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a fact?&rdquo;&nbsp; This to Hammond was an
entirely <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>new side light on the character of the pulp camp
superintendent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True as your standing there,&rdquo; emphasised the
skipper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, all of us boat captains have standing
orders that any of them chaps with their collars buttoned behind
is to travel free back and forth to the camps whether they have a
pass or not.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the same in the camp; they
ain&rsquo;t charged anything for grub and bunk and everybody has
orders to use them polite and decent.&nbsp; At the same time, the
Big Boss lets the preachers see they&rsquo;re to steer wide of
him.&nbsp; He has a way of doing that, you know, and the wise
ones know enough not to try any of their holy groaning on a
hard-boiled egg like him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been every known kind of soul-saving
genius knocking around our camps in my time; Catholic priests,
highfaluting English churchers, Methodist missionaries, Salvation
Army drum-beaters and the like,&rdquo; continued the
captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I only know of one preacher who tried
mixing it with Acey Smith.&nbsp; He was a bush-camp evangelist
they called Holy Henry that used to rant to the lumber-jacks and
lead them in psalm-singing all the way from the Soo up to the
Rainy and the Lake of the Woods.&nbsp; Holy Henry was a wizened
up bit of a man with big, thick glasses and mild-looking blue
eyes back of them.&nbsp; But, Lord, man, hadn&rsquo;t he a temper
when he got blazing away at the devil and all his works!&nbsp;
He&rsquo;d chew up half a dozen dictionaries getting high-brow
words to lambast sin and back-sliding, and he&rsquo;d mix
&rsquo;em up with camp slang in a way that would get the boys
whether they wanted to listen to him or not.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d
&rsquo;ve been a popular guy, that preacher, if he hadn&rsquo;t
been so death on all the little games of chance the lumber-jack
has a weakness for.&nbsp; That kind of gave him a black eye all
over the North.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were taking out timber in the Dog Bay country <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>when Holy
Henry paid us his visit.&nbsp; The North Star camps were wide
open in them days; nothing was barred but wild women and
promiscuous booze-running.&nbsp; There was every known manner of
winning or losing a wad from big wheels-of-fortune, chuck-a-luck,
paddle-wheels and stud poker down to nigger craps.&nbsp; Nobody
ever interfered so long as the men were on their jobs on time and
there was no knife-sticking or gun-play.&nbsp; Why, the whole
bunch used to gulp dinner like a lot of brush-wolves just so
they&rsquo;d have the biggest part of their noon-hour trying
their chances for easy money.&nbsp; Some of the lucky ones
cleaned up a pile of money and some that weren&rsquo;t got
cleaned out even to their whole season&rsquo;s wages and their
packsacks.&nbsp; Them was roaring days!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When this here Holy Henry hits the camps everybody got
to speculating just what end of the horn he&rsquo;d come out at,
and of course there were some long stakes put up right on that
there question, but all the big odds was on Holy Henry breaking
down on the job for quits inside of two weeks.&nbsp; I was in
charge of a river gang in them days, and I remember having a
nifty side-bet that he&rsquo;d get so sick of trying to break up
things he&rsquo;d just slip away faking a bad cold or something
of that sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what happened wasn&rsquo;t what any of us had
figured on.&nbsp; The first thing that fool preacher did was to
go to the super&rsquo;s. office and appeal to him to put the lid
on.&nbsp; Acey Smith looks down at the little fellow with the
thick glasses and the weak eyes with that sort of good-natured
curiosity you see on a big St. Bernard dog when a poodle gets in
his way.&nbsp; &lsquo;This ain&rsquo;t any Sunday school
we&rsquo;re running out here, Holy Henry,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;and saving souls isn&rsquo;t exactly in my line; but if
you can throw a scare of hell-fire into this outfit of blacklegs
so that they&rsquo;ll thumb hymn-books instead of poker decks, go
to it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s your particular business and I
won&rsquo;t put any sticks in your <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>way.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he turns away
with that little demon-grin of his and goes back to his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of us that had big bets on the preacher quitting
early thought to hurry him up by getting him peeved.&nbsp; So
when he came out all sort of wilted-like we says to him to get
his goat: &lsquo;What you going to do about it now, Holy
Henry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am going to pray for Brother Smith,&rsquo; he
surprises us by replying.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know he&rsquo;s going to
be on the side of the Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That made us roar so that half of the camp heard
us.&nbsp; &lsquo;Brother Smith,&rsquo; mind you, he called
him.&nbsp; We never quite got over that, but none dared to twit
the super. about it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s mighty touchy on some
things, is Acey Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All went along pretty much as per usual till Sunday
came.&nbsp; Sunday was the red-letter gambling day at the North
Star camps because the boys had full time at it with no other
worries.&nbsp; Some of &rsquo;em used to piece the bull cooks to
bring their meals to them so they wouldn&rsquo;t miss a deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Henry had announced a morning service in a shack
that had been turned over to him for that purpose, but not a
man-jack turned up to it but an old Injun halfwit who&rsquo;d
been roped in by the Salvation Army and a one-eyed Hunkie
who&rsquo;d got religion at one of the weekday meetings.&nbsp;
Holy Henry kneels down with his two-men congregation and prays
silently for a few minutes.&nbsp; Then he went forth
&lsquo;clothed in the wrath of the Lord&rsquo; as he called
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And believe me, boy, <i>that</i> was some wrath.&nbsp;
Somewhere outside he gathered up a piece of a broken handspike,
and brandishing it around his head, he lands into first one camp
shack and then another.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t make any mistake
picking them random that way; they <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>were all going full tilt.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;d burst through a door and land in like a little package
of greased hurricane.&nbsp; Out would go his foot and over would
go a table, chips, cards, money and all.&nbsp; Then he&rsquo;d
swing his club within an inch of the faces of the crowd.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Out of here, you bleary-eyed, low-lived, pigeon-toed,
white-livered disciples of Baal!&rsquo; he&rsquo;d yell.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Out, you sin-corroded, knock-kneed, flannel-mouthed
desecrators of the Lord&rsquo;s Day!&nbsp; Out, I say, for the
wrath of God Almighty is upon you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;d be surprised to see how quick he
cleaned up the whole works.&nbsp; In about two minutes he&rsquo;d
smashed up about a thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of slot-machines
and fortune-wheels with that hand-spike club of his.&nbsp; The
crowd at first just stood around sort of paralysed and
didn&rsquo;t lift a finger to stop him.&nbsp; There was low
growls, lots of curses, and threats of ganging him, but being
that he was a preacher nobody seemed ready to start things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the lads with level heads decided to go down
and get the super. to interfere and decide what was to be done
with the wild-eyed preacher.&nbsp; Smith was reading one of them
high-brow books in his office when the delegation bursts
in.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t say a word, just got up, slips on his
mackinaw and goes out to locate the cause of the disturbance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Henry was smashing things about in the sixth shack
on his list when the Big Boss poked his head in the door with the
gang crowding up at his rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What in hell does this mean?&rsquo; the super.
raps out, spearing the preacher with them wicked, snapping black
eyes of his.&nbsp; His face was like chalk from the cold anger he
was holding back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Henry was in the act of dumping a lot of poker
chips and cards into the stove.&nbsp; The sweat was running down
his face in little creeks and his thick glasses had <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>got all
steamed up, which didn&rsquo;t matter because he was seeing all
red up to that time.&nbsp; But the Big Boss&rsquo;s words hit him
like cold chunks of ice that had been shot into his system and
the pep seemed to go out of him all at once.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d seen
bigger and stronger men than Holy Henry break down like that in
front of Acey Smith, and I almost began to feel sorry for this
trembling little bit of whiff of a fellow with that black devil
of a man towering over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the Lord&rsquo;s Day,&rsquo; he
stammers.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was just cleaning up these&mdash;these
hell parlours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hell parlours&mdash;hell parlours,&rsquo; echoes
the super.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who in blue blazes gave you a license to
wreck the camp?&nbsp; Tell me that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little fellow looked more sorrowful than ever and
he says sort of quietlike: &lsquo;I thought you were on our side,
Brother Smith; I was doing this in the name of the Lord, Jesus
Christ.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ever saw a change come over the face of a man it
was that that came over the super&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He drew back
like as if something had hit him, and the palms of his hands went
up to his face as though he was choking.&nbsp; Maybe you&rsquo;ve
seen him do that sometimes?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like as if a devil
inside him was trying to jump out and was strangling him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But next minute he walks over to the preacher and takes
him by the arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Finish your job, Holy Henry,&rsquo;
he says, &lsquo;and if any one so much as lifts a finger at you,
well&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t finish, but turns and glowers at the
gawping crowd like a lion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Men,&rsquo; he orders,
&lsquo;the lid&rsquo;s down tight on Sunday gambling in these
camps.&nbsp; You get that straight!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said it, and that meant it was law.&nbsp; And
it&rsquo;s been law in the North Star camps ever since.</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>&ldquo;What became of Holy Henry?&nbsp; Now, I
don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Anyway, he was only a few days in the
camp after that incident.&nbsp; At one of his meetings he made
some fool remark about the Big Boss seeing a great light suddenly
like the Bible says St. Paul did.&nbsp; That settled him for
keeps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next morning Acey Smith meets the preacher and
stops him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Holy Henry,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;you&rsquo;ve shot your bolt&mdash;you&rsquo;re through
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But, Brother Smith,&rsquo; expostulates the
little fellow, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve just barely started my work in
the Lord&rsquo;s vineyard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You beat it out on the next tug to some other
vineyard&mdash;and don&rsquo;t come back!&rsquo; cuts in the Big
Boss, cold as ice.&nbsp; &lsquo;And listen: I&rsquo;m not brother
to you nor to any other man.&nbsp; Furthermore, I ain&rsquo;t any
St. Paul seeing lights; I&rsquo;m just a fighting he-man who
doesn&rsquo;t pray to God nor the Devil either.&nbsp; All I ask
both of them to do is to give me a sporting chance to make good
at my job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got me wrong about stopping that
Sunday gambling stunt,&rsquo; he continues.&nbsp; &lsquo;I did
that partly because I can&rsquo;t help being on the side of the
man who&rsquo;s got the guts to back up his convictions when the
whole crowd is against him.&nbsp; But I put the lid down mostly
because it struck me it would be good policy for the North Star
to make its men take a rest on Sunday.&nbsp; You go and pack your
turkey&mdash;the next tug leaves at noon.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The skipper paused when he had concluded his story.&nbsp;
After a silent moment he turned to Hammond.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now what
do you think of that for a hard-hearted speech?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just sounds like Acey Smith,&rdquo; responded Hammond,
&ldquo;and I take it that what he told Holy Henry was just about
the truth about himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably&mdash;probably,&rdquo; reiterated the captain
in an <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>absent sort of a way as he fixed his gaze on the city
wharves they were nearing.&nbsp; &ldquo;But at the same time, I
dunno.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a strange streak in that same Acey
Smith.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s things he&rsquo;s done and does, on
the quiet, that makes us older heads with the company admire him
in spite of ourselves.&nbsp; But you can never get to know the
Big Boss, no matter how long you&rsquo;re around where he
is.&nbsp; Just when you think you know him is the time he&rsquo;s
liable to do or say something so sudden and unexpected it will
make your blood run cold.&nbsp; It strikes me while he&rsquo;s
talking to you with his tongue his mind is always busy thinking
and plotting something else&mdash;thinking up plans maybe a year
ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This coming strike will likely give him lots of scope
for thinking,&rdquo; observed Hammond dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he won&rsquo;t have so much to do with settling or
breaking the strike,&rdquo; declared the captain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Them orders will come to Slack and him from their
higher-ups.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The skipper pressed a signal to the engine-room to slow
down.&nbsp; They were swinging in to the city wharf.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Hammond alighted on the docks of Kam City and walked the
streets expecting at any moment a blue-coated policeman or a
plain-clothes detective would step forward and take him into
custody in connection with the Gildersleeve disappearance.&nbsp;
But no such thing happened.&nbsp; The very boldness of his entry
must have set the sleuths of the law off guard, for at no time
did he even find himself under suspicious scrutiny.</p>
<p>One thing at first absorbed his thoughts to the exclusion of
everything else.&nbsp; That was the uncertainty of what might
have happened to Josephine Stone.&nbsp; Where could she have gone
from the island?&nbsp; The appearance <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>of Acey Smith in the vicinity of the
island alone in his motorboat made him the more uneasy.&nbsp; It
all brought home to him a dark thought that he had all along been
trying to fight off&mdash;that Josephine Stone some way or
another must be entangled in the baffling mystery of the
Nannabijou Limits.&nbsp; But, in spite of constantly rising
perplexities, he refused to think of her in bitterness or that
she had in any sense been consciously deceiving him.&nbsp; He
would not believe that a woman such as she would give her lips to
a man, as she had to him, either in spirit of coquetry or to
further dark intrigue.</p>
<p>It was possible she had merely gone away in her motorboat for
a trip along the lakeshore, or she might have come over to the
city for the day.&nbsp; But there had been a deserted look about
her cottage on the island that weighed in upon Hammond&mdash;made
him feel that something else had happened.&nbsp; Anyway, he must
hustle with the affairs he had come to the city to attend to, so
that he could get back to the limits and find out for certain
where she had gone.</p>
<p>Gold lettering on a window in the second storey of a business
block across the street reminded him that he had mapped out a
definite program for the day and that right here was where he
must make his start.&nbsp; The sign marked the quarters of the
American consul.&nbsp; There he would find the little grey man,
Eulas Daly, the first on his mental list of interviews.&nbsp; He
crossed the street and sought out the consul&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>A tall, slim, alert-looking young man rose from his desk and
genially inquired of what service he could be.</p>
<p>Hammond passed him his card.&nbsp; &ldquo;Might I see Mr.
Daly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Daly?&rdquo; repeated the other with a puzzled
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Mr. Eulas Daly, American consul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mere error in names, Mr. Hammond.&nbsp; I am the <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>American
consul in charge here, but my name is Frank W.
Freeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; surmised Hammond.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
has been a change&mdash;Mr. Daly has been recently transferred to
another post?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a year ago, my friend,&rdquo; replied Mr. Freeman
definitely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Daly was transferred to the Buenos
Aires office in October of last year and I have been in charge
here since then.&nbsp; Perhaps there&rsquo;s something I could do
for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that rate, no.&nbsp; Thank you,&rdquo; acknowledged
Hammond concealing as best he could his amazement and
chagrin.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a personal matter between myself and
Mr. Daly.&nbsp; I have been misinformed as to his
location.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hoaxed!</p>
<p>Inured as Hammond was becoming to trickery and mystification,
this latest revelation brought about a poignant
disappointment.&nbsp; It seemed the more he probed the incidents
following his contract with Norman T. Gildersleeve to go to the
Nannabijou Limits the more complicated things became.&nbsp; Every
attempt he had made to get at the bottom of things had resulted
in fresh bewilderment until everything appeared like a bedevilled
dream.&nbsp; But it was no dream.&nbsp; Cold conviction was upon
him that it was quite the contrary&mdash;that it was a series of
baffling incidents promoted for a dark purpose by a sinister
agency behind the scenes somewhere.</p>
<p>According to this latest piece of information, the man giving
his name as Eulas Daly, United States consul at Kam City, and who
had brought about his meeting with Norman T. Gildersleeve, was
travelling under false colours.&nbsp; If he were really a friend
of Norman T. Gildersleeve there should have been no necessity for
that.&nbsp; The obvious conclusion then was that he was a
confederate of those who had lured Gildersleeve off the
train.&nbsp; No <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>doubt it was he who framed up the mysterious message
that led the millionaire to leave the coach at Moose Horn
Station, for Hammond now felt certain that the note delivered
while he was in consultation with the president of the
International Investment Corporation was a forgery, and that
Gildersleeve had either been kidnapped or had met with foul
play.</p>
<p>Responsibility to the man who had employed him for some secret
purpose that was not yet obvious demanded immediate action on his
part.&nbsp; It would be foolhardy, he conceded, to longer attempt
to fathom the mystery alone or to conceal what he knew in
connection with the affair.&nbsp; Before he reported to the
police authorities, he felt it would be wisdom to consult the
principals of the Kam City Pulp and Paper Mills, who, if anybody,
should be closest in touch with any new developments in the
Gildersleeve mystery.</p>
<p>He dropped into a hotel whence he telephoned the city offices
of the paper company.&nbsp; He was told that Artemus Duff,
president and general manager, was out at the works and might not
be back all afternoon.&nbsp; Hammond decided to go out to the
works, and, as they were located at the extreme easterly limits
of the city, he walked down to Front Street, which ran along the
harbour, to catch a street car.&nbsp; He was standing at a car
stop when the face of a man at the wheel of a motor car that
whizzed by seemed to him to be startlingly familiar.</p>
<p>The motor car stopped a block up at the corner above the short
street leading from the city docks.&nbsp; A man got out, paused a
second on the walk looking down the street, then disappeared into
the building on the corner.</p>
<p>Hammond&rsquo;s first breathless impression was
confirmed.&nbsp; The little grey man who got out of the car was
the man who had introduced himself on the train as Eulas Daly,
American consul.</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>The
young man lost no time in reaching the spot.&nbsp; The man who
had got out of the car was not in the drug store on the corner,
so he must have passed in the double doors just next it and gone
up the stairs.&nbsp; Hammond took the steps three at a
bound.&nbsp; The first floor up was entirely occupied by law
offices.&nbsp; On the double glass doors he read the
gilt-lettered legend:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">WINCH, STANTON &amp;
REID<br />
Barristers, Solicitors,<br />
Etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He decided to make a try for his man in there.&nbsp; At the
rail just beyond the doors he was met by a young woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very important that I meet the gentleman who just
came in,&rdquo; he announced to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Winch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Mr. Winch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took his card, passed into one of the glass-partitioned
private offices and returned after what to Hammond seemed an
unjustifiable delay.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Winch will see you in ten
minutes,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just take a seat,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond was forced to cool his heels till the girl, after
responding to an office &rsquo;phone call, indicated that Mr.
Winch was ready to receive him.</p>
<p>Hammond at last had struck the right trail.&nbsp; The little
grey man gazing up at him from across the desk in the private
office was none other than the bogus Eulas Daly.&nbsp; But Winch
did not look the least flustered; in fact, there was the barest
trace of the geniality he had worn in the role of the American
consul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hammond,&rdquo; he opened quietly, &ldquo;I have a
shrewd notion what questions you have in mind to demand of
me.&nbsp; But, before we proceed with that, will you kindly tell
me why you have violated your contract with Mr. <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>Gildersleeve by leaving the Nannabijou Limits without
notification?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m tired up with the whole
business,&rdquo; exploded the young man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because
I&rsquo;m not quite ass enough to stick out there on an
assignment from a man who&rsquo;s dropped out of sight.&nbsp;
And, in the next instance, I want to know from you why
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, just a moment,&rdquo; insisted Mr.
Winch.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come to that presently.&nbsp; Did
you know that your leaving the limits at this particular time may
seriously jeopardise the plans Mr. Gildersleeve had in
mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gildersleeve has disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so.&nbsp; That, however, does not prevent his
associates carrying on, does it?&nbsp; As I understood it, you
agreed with Mr. Gildersleeve to remain at the limits in the
capacity he sent you until you received word to return, and he
emphasised the injunction that you were to remain no matter what
apparently unusual things happened.&nbsp; Is that not a fact, Mr.
Hammond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a fact&mdash;Hammond felt the full force of it
now.&nbsp; For the moment he was not prepared with a reply.&nbsp;
He was in grips with one of the most brilliant cross-examiners in
the north country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we will let that pass for the moment,&rdquo; the
lawyer proceeded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t consulted any
one else in the city about this matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I was on my way to look up President Duff of
Kam City Pulp and Paper Mills when I dropped in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You acted very wisely in coming here first,&rdquo;
commended Mr. Winch.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would urge you not to consult
Mr. Duff or any others about it, and, I might add, it is of as
deep concern to you as it is to us that Mr. Gildersleeve&rsquo;s
intimate affairs in this matter should not become public under
any consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told me why, when you
accosted me on the train, you found it necessary to impersonate
an American consul who has long since left the city,&rdquo;
insisted the impetuous Hammond.</p>
<p>A wry smile broke faintly over the lawyer&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gildersleeve was to blame for that,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;He insisted, for some reason that was never
quite clear to me, that I should not disclose my real identity to
you.&nbsp; It may have been that, in case you did not feel
inclined to consider the suggestion to meet him, he did not wish
you to know his legal advisor was acting as go-between.&nbsp; The
use of Eulas Daly&rsquo;s name was almost accidental.&nbsp; An
old card of his must have by some chance got into my case.&nbsp;
It appealed to me that for the interim the role of Eulas Daly
would do as well as any other.&nbsp; I did not expect to see you
again until this business was over with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This explanation did not impress Hammond favourably, but it
was evident, from the matter-of-fact manner in which he related
the deception, that Winch cared little how he took it.</p>
<p>So Hammond feigned as great an indifference as he asked:
&ldquo;Then you really did the preliminary work at Mr.
Gildersleeve&rsquo;s instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winch plainly did not relish being kept in the position of the
cross-examined.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied with a
shrug.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gildersleeve had selected you as a likely man
for the job during the day while you were sitting talking to a
companion next table to him in the dining car.&nbsp; He asked me
to feel you out about it, and, at the moment you dropped into the
smoker that evening, I was just about to set out in search for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more question, Mr. Winch,&rdquo; pursued
Hammond.&nbsp; &ldquo;You spoke a few moments ago about his
associates <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>&lsquo;carrying on&rsquo; while Mr. Gildersleeve is
absent.&nbsp; Am I to take it from that he <i>is</i> still
alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are certain of nothing,&rdquo; answered the other,
&ldquo;but we have hopes for the best.&nbsp; It is not a point
over which you need waste worry; the plans for his enterprises
will be carried on as before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is nothing I could do that would assist in
clearing up the mystery of Mr. Gildersleeve&rsquo;s
disappearance?&rdquo; insisted Hammond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not a thing.&nbsp; Your plan is to return to
the Nannabijou Limits this afternoon as quietly as
possible,&rdquo; suggested the legal man.&nbsp; &ldquo;There you
had best resume your former r&ocirc;le until such time as you are
communicated with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds very well,&rdquo; impatiently commented
Hammond, &ldquo;but, in the event of Mr. Gildersleeve having
disappeared permanently, I might remain there for a very long
time without any particular purpose being served.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In such a case I will personally take the
responsibility of instructing you when to return,&rdquo; assured
Winch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Furthermore, I will take it upon myself to
guarantee that you are paid for your services according to the
verbal contract between yourself and Mr. Gildersleeve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond hesitated a moment.&nbsp; He was thinking about
Josephine Stone and the possibilities of being near her again;
otherwise he would not have entertained any proposal to return to
the limits under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Before he could reply, however, there came sounds of a loud
commotion from somewhere on the streets outside; jeers, the
shrill cries of young boys and the rush of many feet.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>Winch rose from his desk and hurried to the window.&nbsp; As
he looked out his face went grey with alarm and his lips moved in
a single gasp:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>&ldquo;Hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond was at his side in a trice.&nbsp; The window
overlooked the short street leading up from the city dock, where,
in a surging crowd of men and street urchins, two red-coated
policemen of the Canadian mounted force were escorting up the
street a tall, black-whiskered man in dark baggy clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Some one has made a tremendous
blunder</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winch thus spoke his thoughts with a solemnity that betrayed
his inward agitation.&nbsp; At that instant the man between the
two mounties looked up toward Winch&rsquo;s window and gave
utterance to a loud fierce yell.</p>
<p>Hammond gave a gasp of surprise.</p>
<p>The prisoner was the Rev. Nathan Stubbs, camp preacher at
Nannabijou Limits.</p>

&ldquo;A BEAUTIFUL, PALE DEVIL&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the day that Louis Hammond left
the Nannabijou Limits for Kam City, Acey Smith and one other were
astir long before the young newspaper man had opened an eye in
his comfortable bunk.&nbsp; Acey Smith, as was his usual custom,
shaved before the large mirror opposite the eastern window of his
bedroom, his thoughts busy with a problem that had been agitating
him since his visit to Amethyst Island the day before.</p>
<p>It was while completing the last few deft touches to his
toilet that the Big Boss of the Nannabijou Limits caught
momentarily a reflection in the glass of a face and figure moving
past the window back of him.</p>
<p>As if the fleeting reflection in the glass had brought him an
inspiration, he paused in wiping the talc powder from his
chin.&nbsp; Then he smote the little table below with a clenched
fist such a blow that the articles thereon went tottering.</p>
<p>He whirled and turned his attention to a packsack into which
he hastily stowed a number of wrapped packages, strapped the flap
of the pack and slipped his arms through the shoulder
pieces.&nbsp; He took a swift survey of surroundings from the
windows, then stepping outside sauntered down to the bell tent on
the water-front occupied by Inspector Little of the Mounted
Police.</p>
<p>He was with the inspector perhaps twenty minutes, when he
accompanied the latter to the dining camp.&nbsp; <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>They had
breakfast and returned to the dock, whence the superintendent
soon shot out in his red racing boat which tore its way out of
sight on the rolling expanse of Superior.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The tug bearing Hammond to Kam City was well out on the lake
when Acey Smith returned.&nbsp; He tied the red racer up in its
berth on the limits docks and immediately made his way to his
office.&nbsp; The enthusiasm that had sat upon his face when he
had departed earlier in the day was gone.&nbsp; In its place was
a tired, worried look.</p>
<p>As he entered the office, a handsome, dark-eyed young woman
seated by a window dropped a book to her lap and looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiting long, Yvonne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inquiry was casual but kindly.&nbsp; He whipped open a
drawer of his desk, filled a silver cigarette case from a large
tin box.&nbsp; Then he fitted a cigarette in an amber holder and
lighted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just since the tug came in.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a
suggestion of pique in the girl&rsquo;s tones that went
unnoticed.&nbsp; Her gaze followed his every movement with
fascinated intensity.&nbsp; But when he looked her way her eyes
fell quickly.</p>
<p>Followed a long pause.&nbsp; Acey Smith stood looking out a
window, half turned to her, the while he drew hungrily at the
cigarette, his eyes in an abstracted stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has something happened?&nbsp; Is&mdash;is anything
wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned at the deep anxiety in Yvonne&rsquo;s tones.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, nothing wrong, Yvonne&mdash;I&rsquo;m just a bit
spent.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been a trying morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tossed the cigarette stub into the stove and drawing a
long, sealed manilla envelope from a pocket handed it to
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yvonne,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want you to go
over to <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>Kam City with me in the racer this afternoon.&nbsp;
When we land you are to go to J. J. Slack&rsquo;s office and
deliver this letter from J.C.X. to him.&nbsp; If he asks any
questions, tell him the wireless broke down and it was impossible
to get in touch with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to see Mr. Slack
yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely, but say nothing to him about it.&nbsp; I am
leaving for Montreal to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Montreal?&rdquo;&nbsp; She bit her nether lip in
the nervous effort it cost her to follow up:
&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, alone.&nbsp; Why do you ask, Yvonne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She toyed with the letter he had handed her, her eyes
averted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alexander,&rdquo;&mdash;she pronounced the
name softly and with a great diffidence&mdash;&ldquo;who is the
girl living on Amethyst Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acey Smith smiled good-naturedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Stone, you
mean?&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll be leaving here shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&mdash;depends on
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know her before she came out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw her before.&nbsp; But why all this catechism,
Yvonne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yvonne Kovenay arose.&nbsp; She threw out her hands in an odd
gesture.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to ask you, Alexander, do you think
I work for you as I do for the money you pay me alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face became suddenly serious.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why no, Yvonne,
such service as yours could not be bought with a monthly
cheque.&nbsp; Love of one&rsquo;s work alone could inspire
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl winced as if she had been struck.&nbsp; &ldquo;Love
of my work?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Great God, did you
think it was love of my work?&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>III</h3>
<p>Acey Smith receded a step as she came forward, a magnificent
little creature under stress of her emotions; her bosom heaving,
her long lashes dank and her great dark eyes brilliant with the
tears that forced themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alexander, it has all been for&mdash;for <i>love of
you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flung herself upon him, her soft arms about his neck, her
dusky head with its masses of ebony hair upon his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she cried in sobbing abandon, &ldquo;a
thousand times yes&mdash;for you, my Alexander, king of all men,
the strongest of the strong!&rdquo;&nbsp; The tiger soul of her
cried out for its chosen mate: &ldquo;All other men are dwarfs
beside you; you crush them with your very smile.&nbsp; Who is
there among them all can stand before your might?&nbsp; How could
woman help loving you as I do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have tried hard not to do this!&nbsp; I tried to
be patient in the hope that some day you would&mdash;would
understand.&nbsp; Then, then, she came&mdash;that girl on
Amethyst Island with her mincing ways and her haughty
airs&mdash;to ensnare you.&nbsp; I have been mad, mad, mad, at
thought of your going to her.&nbsp; Then&mdash;then it came to me
that I&mdash;I was only&mdash;your woman spy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gently, he endeavoured to release himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not my
woman spy,&rdquo; he corrected her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Remember you
came to me and I employed you on behalf of the North Star
Company&mdash;for J.C.X.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the North Star&mdash;for J.C.X.!&rdquo;&nbsp; She
echoed it derisively.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the North Star to
me?&nbsp; Do you think I would work as I have done; run risks of
reputation, even life itself at times, for this J.C.X., a man I
have never seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t we treated you fairly?&rdquo; he
argued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t your salary next only to that of
the president himself?&nbsp; <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>Hasn&rsquo;t the North Star done
everything within reason to reward you and show its appreciation
of your services?&nbsp; What&mdash;what more is it you could ask,
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;your love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She whispered it softly with a quick intaking of breath, her
eyes opening momentarily in a quick, melting flash under his.</p>
<p>Acey Smith pushed her from him impatiently, almost
roughly.&nbsp; His face became cold and hard, unutterably cruel
for an instant.&nbsp; Then that wisp of a devil-sneer flickered
on his handsome, ruthless features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My love!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he laughed a laugh that was
not pleasant to hear.&nbsp; &ldquo;What foolishness put it into
your head that I could love, Yvonne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His scorning tones bit the woman to the quick.&nbsp; Her dark
eyes flashed dangerously.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was her!&nbsp; It was
her!&rdquo; she flamed at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;That baby-faced thing
down on Amethyst Island.&nbsp; I thought until she came you were
what you seemed to be&mdash;a beautiful, pale devil.&nbsp; And as
a devil I worshipped you, silently and in secret, fondly
believing I nor any other woman could claim you.&nbsp; I thought
you were more than human&mdash;a being of destiny to whom all
passions and weaknesses were scornful trivialities.&nbsp;
Then&mdash;then she came&mdash;and I saw the change in you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she cried, her face chalk-white from the
pent-up emotions surging within her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alexander, the
thing which that thought awakens within me I tell you makes me
mad&mdash;mad!&nbsp; You may never be mine, but you <i>never</i>,
<i>never</i> shall be hers.&nbsp; <i>I will
kill</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came a terrible look into the face of Acey Smith that
sent her staggering back in deadly affright.&nbsp; Only by a
supreme effort did the man appear to get a grip on himself.</p>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>But
in another instant he was calm and smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor,
little Yvonne, my poor, little, faithful Yvonne,&rdquo; he
soothed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Child, you are just a bit over-strung; you
have been working too hard lately.&nbsp; To-night you are going
up to Winnipeg, to your father, on a month&rsquo;s vacation, and
I am going to pick out a little present for you when we get over
to the city&mdash;something by which in after days you may
remember one who was not what he should have been, but who
thought much of you.&nbsp; Let us forget this little incident for
the present.&nbsp; We have work in hand to-day, you and
I&mdash;big work&mdash;and you are going to Kam City with me now
to deliver that letter, like a good little girl, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a child that has been chastised, then petted, she warmed
under the light caress of his hand, the deep, musical persuasive
qualities of his voice and the tremendous, irresistible magnetism
of the man.</p>
<p>She looked up at him as of old, tried to meet those
soul-searching black eyes with their wicked masterfulness,
wavered and nodded acquiescence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would, Yvonne.&nbsp; This,&rdquo; he
announced, &ldquo;will be the beginning of the North Star&rsquo;s
greatest coup&mdash;and its last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its last?&rdquo;&nbsp; She echoed it
apprehensively.</p>
<p>He did not answer, but sprang to the window, a light of
sinister amusement breaking over his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look,
Yvonne,&rdquo; he called.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come and see what is
happening to your preacher friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down by the docks two mounted policemen were half leading,
half dragging the handcuffed Rev. Nathan Stubbs into the police
motorboat.</p>
<p>The girl gasped.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you say my friend?&rdquo;
she asked, a quaver in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He pretended to be your friend, and you told him what
you should not have told him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>&ldquo;Then you knew?&rdquo;&nbsp; Her face was
scarlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew all.&nbsp; The North Star always
knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was because&mdash;because I was crazy with
jealousy,&rdquo; she pleaded.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was on account of
that Stone girl, and I thought he could tell me who she was and
why you went to see her.&nbsp; I did not tell him all&mdash;not
your great secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My great secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that you are not Acey Smith in
reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed indulgently.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would not matter now
even if you had, Yvonne,&rdquo; he discounted, &ldquo;because you
nor any other could have told him who Acey Smith really is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one man knew that secret&mdash;and he is
dead.&rdquo;</p>

168</span>CHAPTER XV<br />
THE FIAT OF J.C.X.</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Artemus Duff</span>, president and general
manager of the Kam City Pulp and Paper Mills, paid his promised
visit to the office of Hon. J. J. Slack, M.P., president of the
North Star Towing and Contracting Company, about the same hour
that Hammond went up to see Martin Winch, K.C..</p>
<p>The interview in most respects was inconsequential.&nbsp; As
might be surmised, Slack&rsquo;s quest was for any chance bit of
information regarding the rival paper company&rsquo;s plans that
it might be to his advantage to know.&nbsp; His shrewd
after-deductions were that Duff was not in the confidence of his
own associates.</p>
<p>Duff, on the other hand, left the office of the wily
politician no wiser than when he entered, but considerably
reassured regarding the delivery of raw material to the mills
from the Nannabijou Limits.&nbsp; Slack had a bland, big way of
discussing a thing that put others off their guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are enough poles boomed in Nannabijou Bay to keep
your mill running the better part of the coming year,&rdquo; he
told Duff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So our inspectors report,&rdquo; agreed the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poles being there, we are bound to deliver them on
time,&rdquo; reminded Slack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the contract time for the opening of our mill is
drawing near,&rdquo; complained the Kam City Company&rsquo;s <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>president,
&ldquo;and delivery hasn&rsquo;t even been started.&nbsp; Even
the absence of Norman Gildersleeve wouldn&rsquo;t bother me so
much if it were under way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is little for you to lose sleep over on that
point, Mr. Duff,&rdquo; Slack assured him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Once our
present dredging contracts are completed, which I expect will be
in a few days&rsquo; time, our full complement of tugs, carriers
and loading scows will be on the job.&nbsp; Only an act of
Providence could prevent the delivery of those poles on contract
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An act of Providence&mdash;only an act of
Providence?&rdquo; Duff repeated as he prepared to depart.&nbsp;
Just what did Slack mean by dragging that reference in?&nbsp;
However, he had tittered it quite casually, Duff remembered, and
probably it had no special significance.</p>
<p>Slack <i>had</i> uttered it casually; but at that moment, even
the president of the North Star Towing and Contracting Company
had no idea of the real cards to be played.</p>
<p>Something of a revelation came to him that very afternoon.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Shortly after the departure of Artemus Duff, a dark,
striking-looking young woman was ushered into Slack&rsquo;s
private office.&nbsp; She closed the door cautiously behind
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, if it isn&rsquo;t Yvonne,&rdquo; greeted
Slack.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought you were on business west of
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was, J.J.,&rdquo; she replied as familiarly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I hurried back yesterday.&nbsp; I have just come over
from the limits to deliver this special message to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tossed a sealed official envelope on the desk.</p>
<p>Slack tore open the envelope, and, as he studied the contents,
a worried frown gathered on his brow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
you be seated a moment, Miss Kovenay?&rdquo; he requested
absently.</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>Slack
worked with a pencil on a pad of paper deciphering the letter,
which, as was usual with orders from the same source, was in the
North Star&rsquo;s private code.&nbsp; It contained bald
instructions, skeletonised of every spare word:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Instruct North Star newspapers, east and west,
drop conjectures re disappearance Gildersleeve.&nbsp; Print nil
unless actually found dead or alive; then only barest details on
inside pages, without display headings.</p>
<p>Put on double or triple shift, if necessary, on wireless ready
any moment for emergency calls from limits station.&nbsp; File
for wireless every day weather probabilities for east and west
and full predictions Coster&rsquo;s Weather Bureau soon as same
come in.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT.&nbsp; Make no promises re Tugmen&rsquo;s Union
demand for increases and shorter hours, unless advised.&nbsp;
Have papers print articles calculated to foment general
seamen&rsquo;s strike on our own and other great lakes
vessels.&nbsp; Hire more socialist agitators to help stir up
discontent.&nbsp; Strike MUST materialise before day that
dredging contracts are completed.</p>
<p>Sending A. C. Smith to Montreal, special business.&nbsp; If
time, his instructions are to call on you before leaving to
confer on matters above mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(Sgd.)&nbsp; <i>J. C. X.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It literally took the breath out of Slack.</p>
<p>That second last paragraph regarding the tugmen&rsquo;s strike
smote him like a club.&nbsp; The carrying out of these
instructions, he felt, meant personal calamity for him&mdash;his
political doom.</p>
<p>With cold sweat breaking at his temples he looked up to meet
the questioning stare of Yvonne Kovenay&rsquo;s dark eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know who this is from?&rdquo;&nbsp; He asked it
absently like one who scarcely expects a reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; Then leaning forward
over the desk she said it in a whisper scarcely more than
audible: &ldquo;It is from J.C.X.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yvonne, tell me, have <i>you</i> ever met
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a suppressed shudder
in the emphasis.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope I never do meet him.&nbsp;
If I did&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Her voice trailed off to
incoherency.</p>
<p>Hon. J. J. Slack shrugged his heavy shoulders.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, I know what you think, Yvonne.&nbsp; I <i>know</i>
what you think&mdash;it&rsquo;s what they all think.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But Slack&rsquo;s indifferent shrug merely disguised the
goose-flesh shiver that ran through his own frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there anything else, Yvonne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;a personal favour.&rdquo;&nbsp; She pulled
nervously at the fingers of her gloves.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me,
what is that girl doing out at Amethyst Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, how should I know?&nbsp; Is there a girl
stopping at Amethyst Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know she was there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all news to me, Yvonne.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t
Acey Smith know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;she seems to be a friend of his.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The woman&rsquo;s voice bore traces of deep agitation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He spends a lot of time in her company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yvonne Kovenay had risen.&nbsp; She bade Slack a hurried
good-day and whisked out of his office.</p>
<p>Slack, staring speculatively at the door through which she had
vanished, muttered to himself: &ldquo;So Acey Smith has a flame,
and that Kovenay girl he employs as head of his intelligence
bureau is wild with jealousy.&nbsp; H&rsquo;m, there&rsquo;s real
breakers ahead for Smith, or I miss my guess&mdash;and, if
there&rsquo;s a nasty fuss at this particular time I can see
where I get a crisp order from J.C.X. to forthwith dispense with
the services of a certain crafty superintendent.&nbsp; I can see
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was not possible pitfalls for Acey Smith which weighed
heavily on the self-centred J. J. Slack&mdash;it was the
nightmare of the coming strike of North Shore seamen that hung
like a black cloud over him&mdash;the strike <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>that he
would have to precipitate and take the blame for.&nbsp; Until now
he had understood the company&rsquo;s stand-pat attitude was
meant to be a temporary bluff only, and that the grievances of
the men would be met before the strike actually came off.&nbsp;
The orders he had just received dissipated all such fond
illusions.&nbsp; His part in it would validate the total labour
vote in his constituency.&nbsp; Good heavens, it meant
ruin&mdash;complete ruin!</p>
<p>For a long period Slack paced the floor of his office.&nbsp;
Futilely he tried to devise a way out.&nbsp; Five-thirty passed
and the clerks in the outer office departed.&nbsp; Still he
walked the floor.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;there was one way open.&nbsp;
He would fight&mdash;bluff it through against this insane
policy.&nbsp; Suddenly he came to a mental decision.&nbsp; He
flung himself into his swivel chair and buried his face in his
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;
he spat out savagely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see J.C.X. in hell
first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;<i>in hell</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>At the mocking tones Slack looked up and into a face whose
black, commanding eyes rivetted his very soul; whose straight,
firm-set mouth was drawn to a hair-line in its wisp of a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Acey Smith!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The visitor ignored the startled salutation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; he ruminated, &ldquo;that if
you did meet J.C.X. in the regions you mentioned that you would
not change your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Smith, you are aware of the instructions forwarded
to me to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a pretty fair idea of the gist of those
instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think J.C.X. could be prevailed upon to
modify them?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>&ldquo;Modify them?&nbsp; In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With regard to precipitating a strike of the
tugmen.&nbsp; Such a move would be folly&mdash;downright
folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am certain no such modification could be
obtained,&rdquo; declared Acey Smith.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know quite
as well as I that an order from J.C.X. is a command,
and&mdash;well, you know what has happened to those that have
failed in carrying on for the North Star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the North Star has never had a strike in its
history.&nbsp; It has been known for its fair and generous
treatment of its men,&rdquo; argued Slack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Its
policy has always been to pay employ&eacute;s the highest wages
and a bonus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct.&nbsp; But for this once J.C.X. has seen fit to
change the policy of the North Star, with the North Star&rsquo;s
own particular ends in view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It spells disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the North Star Company&mdash;for all of us.&nbsp;
Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point that&rsquo;s worrying you,
Mr. Slack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The challenge came swift and sharp like the crack of a
whip.&nbsp; Though nominally his subordinate, there were crises
in the history of the North Star Company when Slack had to
mentally acknowledge a master in Acey Smith&rsquo;s
presence.&nbsp; That was perhaps because he knew Smith in some
way held the confidence of the directing mind of the firm,
and&mdash;there was another reason that was not as tangible.</p>
<p>A wan remnant of what was meant to be a patient smile broke
over the politician&rsquo;s fat face.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be
absolutely candid then,&rdquo; he agreed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Dominion election coming&mdash;the House
may go to the country at any time.&nbsp; Smith, this proposed
strike, with us refusing a settlement, would alienate every
solitary labour vote in the North.&nbsp; Why, man, I
couldn&rsquo;t run against a yellow dog and win; it would ruin my
political future.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>Acey
Smith approached the other deliberately.&nbsp; He leaned forward
until the tips of his inordinately long, tapering white fingers
supported him on the edge of the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slack,&rdquo; he pronounced with cold insolence,
&ldquo;<i>you have no political future</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment!&rdquo;&nbsp; He raised a detaining hand, as
Slack, ashen to the throat, opened his mouth in a sort of sickly
gasp.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am merely uttering the judgment of J.C.X.,
whose spokesman I am for the time being.&nbsp; Your future, as
mine, belongs utterly to the North Star.&nbsp; The day you took
over the president&rsquo;s desk you became a pawn, body and
soul.&nbsp; You knew that; it was put coldly to you.&nbsp; You
accepted in the knowledge that the decisions of the anonymous
head of the North Star Towing and Contracting Company must be
absolute law, to be obeyed without equivocation of any kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slack, the North Star made you; picked you up when you
were a hand-to-mouth, soap-box demagogue with about as much
chance of carving a name in Canadian politics as a celluloid
beetle has of cruising the drought-belts of hell.&nbsp; You were
a brief-hunting, small-town lawyer in those days, dependent on
the political crumbs the big fellows brushed off the table.&nbsp;
If it hadn&rsquo;t been for a mean portion of party patronage you
would have had to tackle honest toil or starve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me refresh your mind on what happened.&nbsp; You
got into the political game in a small way.&nbsp; The North Star
backed you with its money, its influence and its strategy.&nbsp;
You won out against a stronger man&mdash;a victory that surprised
no one more than yourself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had the front, were a hail fellow and well
met.&nbsp; The North Star needed a man of that very type with the
<i>open sesame</i> to inner political circles.&nbsp; In a single
day it elevated you from hopeless penury and insignificance to <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>the highest
office in its gift as nominal head of the North Star and its
coterie of subsidiary companies.&nbsp; You were made the master
of millions, with precedence over many of us who had served the
company faithfully since its earliest beginnings.&nbsp; What did
you promise in return for all these things?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acey Smith, a strange, smouldering glow in his coal-black eyes
that held the trembling Slack transfixed, took the other by the
arm and led him to the south side of the office, to a window that
overlooked the city, its smoked-smudged waterfront, the great
lake and the rugged sweep of the North Shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember, John J.?&rdquo;&nbsp; Acey
Smith&rsquo;s voice was low and vibrant.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was on
this very hill, on the very site of this office, that I stood
with my arm linked in yours as I stand now.&nbsp; You confessed
to me your ruling passion was for power.&nbsp; You intimated you
would sell your very soul to be great, to be mighty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, as the representative of the powerful J.C.X., came
to offer you the thing you craved most.&nbsp; I asked you to look
to the South, to the East and to the West.&nbsp; As far as you
could see and beyond would be your absolute domain.&nbsp; The
North Star was prepared to make you ruler of the whole North
Shore and the Upper Lakes, and a mighty force in the woods beyond
and across the prairie West.&nbsp; You were to have power of a
kind&mdash;a figurehead &rsquo;tis true&mdash;but executive power
patently greater than any other one individual in this whole
Dominion of Canada&mdash;and that was what your heart yearned
for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a price named for this prize&mdash;you
remember?&nbsp; It was your unquestioning obedience at all times
to the will of J.C.X.&nbsp; None was to know whence your
instructions came.&nbsp; This was all laid down very definitely
<a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>to
you&mdash;and, you accepted gladly, without
reservation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slack stood dumb, his gaze averted from the accusing blaze of
the other man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; His relentless inquisitor went
on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need not here dilate on how the North Star has lived
up to its covenant with you.&nbsp; Your family&rsquo;s social
prominence here and at the Capital, the political honours that
have been showered upon you all attest the might that was loaned
you.&nbsp; The North Star has demanded only service in return and
cared not whether it had your gratitude or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you, Slack, that the power that made you a leader
among men has not the will to cast you down again into the depths
from which you came&mdash;that the unseen arm that reached out
and lifted you to wealth and affluence has not the strength to
unmake you and brush you from its path into the discard?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The voice beside Slack was
terrible in its cold intensity.&nbsp; &ldquo;The zero hour in the
history of the North Star is about to strike.&nbsp; Strong men
alone can guide its destinies through that critical hour; the
North Star will brook no vacillating weakling at its helm when it
heads out into the teeth of the tempest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am authorised to bring you this message: <i>The fiat
of J.C.X. is that you accept his recent instructions and carry
them out to the letter or immediately vacate the presidency of
the North Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>All the smug self-confidence had gone out of Slack, leaving
him a towering mass of perspiring flabbiness.&nbsp; But there was
a mulish streak in him that prevailed in the face of his
trepidation.</p>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>He
started to hark back to his primal grievance.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it
wasn&rsquo;t for this strike&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget the strike!&rdquo; cut in Acey Smith.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The strike of the tugmen is a side-issue that will be
forgotten long before a general election can be got under
way.&nbsp; It will last only so long as it serves the ends of the
North Star&mdash;a couple of weeks at the very most.&nbsp; But it
must last until word comes from J.C.X. to settle it.&nbsp; The
men will then be reinstated on their own terms with full back pay
for the time they have been idle.&nbsp; The North Star wants no
hardship to come to its men out of this incident.&nbsp; And, if
the Hon. J. J. Slack, M.P., is then still president of the
company, he shall have the full credit for making the magnanimous
settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slack&rsquo;s face brightened.&nbsp; &ldquo;I begin to see the
light,&rdquo; he acknowledged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the object?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; This strike will preclude delivery of the
poles at Nannabijou Bay to the Kam City Company&rsquo;s mills in
time for them to live up to their agreement with the
government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;d thus automatically forfeit their
rights on the Nannabijou Limits,&rdquo; added Acey Smith, but the
queer, half-pitying ghost of a smile that flickered at the
corners of his mouth escaped the politician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, I see,&rdquo; reiterated Slack, &ldquo;and, by
virtue of that rider in the government contract, the limits would
be returned to us on the terms of our old tender with an
extension of time for the completion of our mill.&nbsp; Great
Scott, that would mean too that the Kam City people would have a
useless mill on their hands they&rsquo;d be forced to turn over
to the North Star at its own price.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s strategy
for you, with a vengeance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;&nbsp; Acey Smith&rsquo;s approval came
with a sardonic chuckle.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is to be hoped the
International Investment <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>Corporation and the Kam City Pulp
and Paper Mills Company make the same wild deductions that you
do, Slack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slack blanched under the rebuff.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, what do you
mean?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this,&rdquo; replied the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you think the North Star would allow this tremendous issue to
depend on such an obvious and clumsy piece of trickery?&nbsp;
Why, man, the Kam City Company would have legal redress whereby
they could force us to settle the strike and live up to our
delivery contract in less than a week&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what on earth is the object of the
strike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a blind&mdash;<i>to hide the real
coup</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the real coup?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One individual could answer that
question&mdash;J.C.X.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slack was silent a moment, then he blurted rather than asked:
&ldquo;Tell me as man to man, Smith, are you J.C.X.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have wondered that you did not ask me that
before,&rdquo; returned the superintendent quietly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can inform you, as man to man, <i>I am not
J.C.X.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;But come, Mr. Slack,&rdquo; he urged next moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re wasting time, and I have yet some things to
attend to before I catch the train east.&nbsp; What answer do I
send from you to J.C.X. regarding those last
instructions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him they will be carried out to the letter,&rdquo;
admonished the president.</p>
<p>Acey Smith extended his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I congratulate you,
J. J.,&rdquo; he offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Smith,&rdquo; called Slack as the other turned
to leave.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait till I get my coat and hat, and
I&rsquo;ll be with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to a locker for the articles of wear.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll slip over to the club and have dinner
together,&rdquo; he suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have
lots of time to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>There
was an eerie emptiness to the ring of his voice in the
room.&nbsp; He whirled with the sentence uncompleted.</p>
<p>Acey Smith was gone.</p>
<p>Slack shrugged uncomfortably.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vanished,&rdquo; he
muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can almost fancy a faint smell of
brimstone fumes hangs about the place.&rdquo;</p>

180</span>CHAPTER XVI<br />
A HOAX THAT PROVED A BOOMERANG</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Don&rsquo;t</span> go away for a
moment, Mr. Hammond.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hammond watching the police
with Rev. Nathan Stubbs as their captive disappeared up street,
turned to see Martin Winch, the lawyer, hurry to his desk
telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One&mdash;O&mdash;Two&mdash;Seven, North,&rdquo; he
called.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bairdwell and Simms?&mdash;Could I speak to
Mr. Simms?&mdash;&nbsp; Hello, Simms, Martin Winch of Winch,
Stanton and Reid speaking&mdash;&nbsp; Simms, would you care to
handle a police court case for us?&mdash;&nbsp; Yes, right away,
if we can arrange the preliminary hearing for this
afternoon&mdash;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a client of ours, Rev. Nathan
Stubbs&mdash;&nbsp; Some trivial charge, yes&mdash;&nbsp; What we
want is to get bail arranged, but there are reasons why we
can&rsquo;t very well be identified with the case just for the
present&mdash;&nbsp; Will explain all that when I see
you&mdash;&nbsp; Could you slip over to the district police court
right now&mdash;&nbsp; Hold things until I get there with the
bondsmen&mdash;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s very decent of you, Simms,
thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re bound for the police station,&rdquo; Winch
explained as he hustled Hammond down the stairs to the street and
into his car at the curb.&nbsp; &ldquo;It might be essential to
have you there, but whatever occurs keep a still mouth unless I
tell you.&nbsp; Simms will do all the talking that is
necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way Winch stopped opposite the entrance to a <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>business
block, and, leaving Hammond in the car, hustled upstairs.&nbsp;
Presently, he returned with two other men who jumped into the
rear seat of the car and Winch started the machine without taking
time to introduce them to Hammond.</p>
<p>Winch led the way into the district magistrate&rsquo;s office,
where Rev. Nathan Stubbs was already arraigned before the
magistrate.&nbsp; The two mounted police were swearing out papers
for his incarceration on a nominal charge of vagrancy.&nbsp;
Winch motioned Hammond to a seat in the rear of the auditorium
and sat down beside him, while the two strangers, whom Hammond
surmised were the bondsmen, went on up and inside the rail, where
they were met by a sleek-looking young man, who, he knew, must be
Simms.&nbsp; The prisoner straightened and a distinct look of
relief came over his face.</p>
<p>It was all very formal, very monotonous, as preliminary
hearings usually are.&nbsp; There was very little talking, and
most of it in an undertone that didn&rsquo;t carry to the point
where Hammond and Winch were sitting.&nbsp; The most audible
sound was the scratching of the magistrate&rsquo;s pen.&nbsp;
Finally it ceased, bail was put up and the magistrate announced
the case adjourned until the following morning.</p>
<p>Winch asked Hammond to wait a moment and went forward and
joined the group around the accused, now temporarily a free man
on one thousand dollars security put up by the two
strangers.&nbsp; Hammond was convinced Winch supplied the
collateral.</p>
<p>The magistrate arose from his desk, and with customary
abruptness the courtroom cleared.&nbsp; Winch, Simms, Rev. Nathan
Stubbs and the two bondsmen left the building through a side
door.&nbsp; Hammond found himself alone.</p>
<p>He was about to go in search of Winch when the latter appeared
at the public entrance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg your pardon, <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>Mr.
Hammond,&rdquo; he apologised.&nbsp; &ldquo;In my haste to get
this beastly matter straightened out I had forgotten about you
for the moment.&nbsp; As it happened, we did not need you, and I
have to leave you to your own resources for a little while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you come up to my office, say in an
hour?&rdquo;&nbsp; Winch looked at his watch.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost five now.&nbsp; Come up at six.&nbsp;
You can&rsquo;t get back to the limits now until to-morrow
morning at the earliest, and it is extremely important I should
have a talk with you before you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The arrangement did not appeal as any too attractive to the
young man, particularly in view of what happened at his afternoon
interview with the lawyer, but he promised to abide by it.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>At the appointed time Hammond went up to the legal offices of
Winch, Stanton and Reid.&nbsp; An impatient-looking young male
clerk was standing by the outer rail with hat and coat on ready
to leave.&nbsp; The balance of the office staff had departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Winch is engaged just now,&rdquo; said the clerk,
&ldquo;but he left word for you to wait here.&nbsp; He will call
you when he is ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having delivered his message,
the youth pushed through the double doors and ran downstairs
three steps at a time.</p>
<p>Hammond swore under his breath.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t bothered
about his evening meal, thinking the session with Winch would be
of short duration, and he was tired and hungry.</p>
<p>He could distinguish the rumble of low-pitched voices in
Winch&rsquo;s private office, but could catch no word of what was
said.&nbsp; Five minutes dragged
by&mdash;ten&mdash;twenty&mdash;thirty.&nbsp; At a quarter to
seven Hammond was furious enough to jump up and leave without
giving any notice.</p>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>The
door of Winch&rsquo;s office opened, and, Winch, poking his head
out, called: &ldquo;Come in, Mr. Hammond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond crossed the threshold and drew back in
amazement.&nbsp; Standing by Winch&rsquo;s desk was a tall man,
iron-grey of hair with a keen face and deepset, piercing dark
eyes.</p>
<p><i>It was Norman T. Gildersleeve</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Hammond?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Gildersleeve greeted the young man quietly, extending his
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t quite prepared to meet me
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scarcely, Mr. Gildersleeve, but&rdquo;&mdash;Hammond
was regaining his composure&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve become quite
used to running into the unexpected since I parted with you on
the night of September the twenty-third.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gildersleeve smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Quite so, quite so,&rdquo;
he agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;However, we&rsquo;ve decided to acquaint
you with some of the missing details that have been baffling you,
Mr. Hammond, though I must confess that there are a few things
that we would like to know more about ourselves.&nbsp; Later
on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, at the club, after dinner,&rdquo; briskly cut in
Martin Winch.&nbsp; &ldquo;You and Mr. Hammond can get together
in a side room and thresh the whole thing out.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d
better hurry over if we don&rsquo;t wish to be locked out of the
caf&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They departed in Winch&rsquo;s car.&nbsp; At the City Club,
Norman T. Gildersleeve&rsquo;s appearance created no sudden
sensation among the scattered few that were present.&nbsp;
Apparently, the New York capitalist was not readily recognised,
though his picture had appeared many times in the papers since
his disappearance.&nbsp; Hon. J. J. Slack, M.P., who was a late
arrival, alone picked him out.&nbsp; Slack came striding over to
the table where Gildersleeve, Winch and Hammond sat awaiting
their order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;if it isn&rsquo;t
Norman Gildersleeve in the flesh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; admonished Gildersleeve in an
undertone as the other gripped his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
anxious for this matter to slip over with as little notoriety as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve already got all the notoriety
that&rsquo;s coming to you,&rdquo; laughed Slack.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The papers have been full of nothing else since you
dropped out of sight.&nbsp; Where on earth have you
been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gildersleeve shrugged.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, just on a little
private hunting trip above Moose Horn,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I needed a rest and thought I&rsquo;d take it in on my way
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slack&rsquo;s brows went up ever so slightly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bag
any big fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asked it innocently enough, but Hammond thought he caught
the faintest of sarcastic inflexions.</p>
<p>Gildersleeve ignored the question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now that
I&rsquo;m back,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m anxious to
see the pulp and paper mill get under way in time.&nbsp; By the
way, Slack, how is the North Star getting on with the
poles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swimmingly, swimmingly,&rdquo; repeated the
politician.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nannabijou Bay is jammed almost to the
last inch with timber.&nbsp; Away over the contract cut, I
believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine.&nbsp; How about delivery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starts next week, soon as we get the last of our
dredging contracts off our hands,&rdquo; replied Slack.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have our whole fleet of equipment on the
job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s nothing in this talk that is going
around of a strike among your tugmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely nothing,&rdquo; emphatically assured
Slack.&nbsp; &ldquo;The North Star never had a strike in its
history.&nbsp; The men tried to put up a bluff of going out, at
the instigation of a nest of agitators, but they&rsquo;ll never
go out&mdash;they know better than to try any of that stuff on
us.&nbsp; See you later, Gildersleeve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gildersleeve&rsquo;s eyes trailed after Slack&rsquo;s
retreating <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>figure in a fixed, hard glitter.&nbsp; &ldquo;When
Ananias quit the job, he never dreamed he would have so
illustrious a successor,&rdquo; he commented grimly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Slack&rsquo;s one grand qualification for the presidency
of the North Star is his magnificent ability as an unmitigated
liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meal progressed in comparative silence.&nbsp; It was after
they had retired to the privacy of a side room that Hammond,
prompted by curiosity he had until now curbed, asked casually:
&ldquo;By the way, Mr. Winch, what became of the camp preacher
you bailed out this afternoon&mdash;the Rev. Nathan
Stubbs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winch looked at Gildersleeve and they both smiled
cynically.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has disappeared&mdash;vanished in thin
air, as you might say,&rdquo; enlightened Winch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And left you in the air with bail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was cheap to lose him at any price,&rdquo; spoke up
Gildersleeve with a frown.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was through with his
job&mdash;and damned good riddance!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Hammond began to see the drift of things.&nbsp; &ldquo;So the
preacher was a detective in your employ?&rdquo; he surmised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly&mdash;and you were sent out there as a foil to
keep them guessing,&rdquo; replied Gildersleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
went in the disguise of preacher because it was the easiest
r&ocirc;le to get away with without suspicion, every sort of
preacher being allowed the run of the camps on account of some
eccentric whim of the superintendent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your disappearance was&mdash;also a
blind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the idea.&nbsp; I told Slack just now
I was on a hunting trip, which was true&mdash;except that I was
hunting inside information, not moose.&nbsp; To make absolutely
sure of no leaks, Winch here was the only one in <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>the plot
with me.&nbsp; The arrest of the bogus preacher might have been a
costly blunder if we hadn&rsquo;t got him out before his identity
was discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they get the charge of vagrancy against
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord only knows.&nbsp; Smith and the gang of crooks
who use him as a crafty, unscrupulous tool in their nefarious
enterprises seem to have even the police of the country in their
power.&nbsp; At any rate, Stubbs was arrested on a nominal charge
of vagrancy, but ostensibly for some unnamed crime he was
supposed to have committed on the limits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Hammond,&rdquo; continued the head of the
International Investment Corporation, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d
better be a little more explicit about matters before I come to a
new proposal I have to make to you.&nbsp; You are fairly well
acquainted with the facts in connection with the previous
struggle with the Kam City Pulp and Paper Mills Company, of which
my corporation is the parent, and the North Star Towing and
Contracting Company, are you not?&mdash;how we succeeded in
getting the rights on the limits this October, pending the
opening of our mill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;One way and another I have picked
up a fairly good notion of the situation,&rdquo; he affirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you may not know,&rdquo; continued the other,
&ldquo;is that a former Canadian company, of which I was the
head, was behind many of the rival enterprises which tried to
fight the North Star in this country, and failed.&nbsp; In fact,
we, the pioneers in development work on the North Shore, were
actually driven out by the North Star, whose crafty, underhand
methods and strange power over the ruling authorities in
government circles made it impossible to meet them in a fair
fight.&nbsp; I was a heavy loser through those ventures, and, I
may tell you that <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>millions are at stake in this present undertaking
projected to break the backbone of the slimy North Star
outfit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we got the edge on them this time from the
start&mdash;and we intend to keep it.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I had
no illusions as to the intentions of the North Star since the
screws were put down tight on them by the new provincial
government.&nbsp; I knew if there were a loop-hole through which
they could slip to prevent delivery of poles to our mill in time
to allow of operation on the date fixed in our agreement with the
government that they would take full advantage of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early last June I placed several secret agents in one
guise and another in the North Star&rsquo;s camps, keeping close
tab on operations and sending in regular reports.&nbsp; They
could discover no grounds for suspecting trickery, however,
except that the superintendent, A. C. Smith, was inaccessible and
his comings and goings in the camp were as mysterious as the man
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then one day, toward the latter end of the summer, all
our secret agents, who had secured positions as clerks, cookees
and lumberjacks, were summarily dismissed and given twenty-four
hours to get off the limits&mdash;all with the exception of an
expert ex-secret service man from Chicago, Arnold by name, who
kept his place in the camp as a consumptive landscape
artist.&nbsp; Arnold made the discovery that there was some
secret rendezvous up in the hill known as the Cup of Nannabijou,
to which he was convinced Acey Smith repaired, though he was
never able to trace him there.&nbsp; He further had a theory that
the unknown powers behind the North Star were kept in touch with
affairs through a wireless plant secreted in the Cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the last report we received from Arnold.&nbsp;
News afterward appeared in the papers that Arnold&rsquo;s hat had
been found floating in a creek up on the hill, and <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>it was
surmised that he had fallen into the rapids of the creek and was
dashed to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arnold, however, eventually turned up, alive, in
Chicago, and later came to my office in New York.&nbsp; The truth
of the matter was he had been waylaid on the banks of the creek,
overpowered and drugged while he was endeavouring to find the
entrance to the Cup.&nbsp; He recovered consciousness in the room
of a waterfront hotel in this city, where he found on the dresser
a parcel and a bulky envelope.&nbsp; The parcel contained the
loose cash he had in his pockets when attacked, his watch,
fountain pen and a new hat similar to the one that fell off his
head into the creek during his struggle with unknown
assailants.&nbsp; In the envelope were all the pencilled notes he
had made and secreted under the floor of his shack, and under the
envelope he found a railway time-table with the connections
between Kam City and Chicago under-scored.&nbsp; Arnold was quite
fed up with the way they did things in Canada, and he took the
obvious hint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this made it the more imperative that I place some
one on the limits who could get to the bottom of what coup the
North Star was planning.&nbsp; I decided to come North myself to
keep in close touch.&nbsp; In order to put our rivals and their
spies off the scent and lend them a false notion of security, I
planned to suddenly disappear off the train before it reached Kam
City.&nbsp; Winch was not to discover this until the following
morning and then see that my remarkable disappearance was given
the widest possible publicity in the newspapers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was while on the way to Kam City that I was
impressed with the advantages of having a foil for the camp
preacher in his work&mdash;some one whose entrance into the camps
at about the same time as himself would arouse Acey Smith&rsquo;s
curiosity and suspicion and keep him for a time off the right
track.&nbsp; I talked the plan <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>over with Winch, and the result was
we engaged you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there was no absolute certainty that Slack would
take any cognizance of my request to find you a job on the
limits, and possibly less that Acey Smith would take you on, even
if he did, but I built on their curiosity being so aroused that
they would employ you just to get at the bottom of what you were
sent there for.&nbsp; Your entire ignorance of any definite
object on the limits would, I conjectured, further baffle
Smith.&nbsp; In the meantime, while his suspicions were focussed
on you, Stubbs was to get in his good work.&nbsp; The result up
to the time of your leaving the limits and Stubbs&rsquo; arrest
was eminently satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think my leaving precipitated Stubbs into trouble
then?&rdquo; asked Hammond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; replied
Gildersleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stubbs at the last minute tried to
prevent your getting on the tug before it left, but that
wasn&rsquo;t what was at the bottom of his arrest.&nbsp; However,
you both did well to stay out there as long as you did.&nbsp; We
discovered the North Star&rsquo;s plot to prevent delivery of the
poles in time to frustrate it, we hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve guessed it.&nbsp; And the strike, as you
have likely further surmised, has been cunningly engineered by
the North Star principals themselves, though, mind you, that
would be a difficult thing to prove and a dangerous statement to
make publicly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; contended Hammond, &ldquo;the North Star
must have known that, under the existing circumstances, you could
bring government pressure to bear to force them to settle the
strike and deliver the poles as per the contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, but therein lay the very advantage of our
knowledge in advance they were bringing this strike on,&rdquo; <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>explained
the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have thus been enabled to get in
private touch with the attorney-general, as well as the minister
of forests and mines, so that the minute the strike breaks a fiat
will come through ordering the North Star to submit their strike
to a swift arbitration.&nbsp; We did not suppose the North Star
was relying on the strike alone to tie up delivery, but took it
as a means to another end, which, undoubtedly was to have the
plants in their various tugs blown up and disabled.&nbsp; The
blame would be laid at the door of extremists among the strikers
and they would thus be so crippled they could not move a pole
from the limits to get our mills running on time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we took care of that part of it,&rdquo; continued
Gildersleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;We got the mounted police on the job
of watching not only the booms at the limits, but the North
Star&rsquo;s waterfront property in this city as well.&nbsp;
Incidentally, to make doubly sure of not being trapped, we wired
Duluth to have tugs and equipment ready to send over to us on a
moment&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew that Acey Smith is leaving for Montreal
to-night?&rdquo; asked Hammond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did,&rdquo; said Gildersleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
superintendent took care to have that generally noised about;
there&rsquo;s even an item in both local papers to-night about
his trip.&nbsp; It has never been Acey Smith&rsquo;s habit to
advertise his personal movements, so we can discount that as
another &lsquo;red herring&rsquo; drawn over the trail.&nbsp;
Just the same we have two detectives shadowing the pulp camp
superintendent&rsquo;s movements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond had to smile over the idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Might as well
send two men to shadow a timber wolf,&rdquo; he observed
ironically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the Devil himself,&rdquo; agreed Gildersleeve.&nbsp;
&ldquo;However, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much to worry
about in that <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>direction.&nbsp; Now we&rsquo;ve come to a matter that
I would like to talk over with you privately, Mr.
Hammond&mdash;if Mr. Winch doesn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the least,&rdquo; said Winch.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you
think you&rsquo;ll not be over-long I&rsquo;ll wait for you in
the rotunda, Norman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not be long, Martin,&rdquo; he was assured
by Gildersleeve.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>&ldquo;There are two loose ends out at those camps I want to
have cleared up right away,&rdquo; briskly opened Gildersleeve
when the door closed behind Winch.&nbsp; &ldquo;The one is what
the North Star has hidden up in the Cup of Nannabijou, and the
other is the purpose of that girl staying out on Amethyst
Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond started.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean Miss Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; The fact that you got on intimate terms with
her should be a very valuable asset to us.&nbsp; I suppose
you&rsquo;ve guessed that Stubbs was the one who so cleverly
brought about your meeting with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I had not guessed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m&mdash;well!&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s get to the
point, Mr. Hammond: What all did you find out from
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please be a little more explicit, Mr. Gildersleeve:
Just what are you driving at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&nbsp; I may not have made myself quite
clear.&nbsp; Just what is her little part in the mystery out at
the limits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond suppressed his irritation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Stone has
absolutely no connection with the North Star&rsquo;s intrigues;
of that I am certain,&rdquo; he replied emphatically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is as much mystified, I am sure, by the strange
occurrences at the limits as we have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She hypnotised you into believing that?&rdquo;&nbsp;
There was a politely shaded sneer in Gildersleeve&rsquo;s
tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>see here, Hammond, you must remember
we are dealing with the cleverest coterie of arch crooks on the
American continent.&nbsp; There is nothing in the finer arts of
intrigue and blackmail they have not practised in the past to
gain their ends.&nbsp; They have never had equals for cunning and
resourcefulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such precedent alone,&rdquo; he pointed out,
&ldquo;should warn us that that girl with her pretty face has
been introduced at this particular juncture with a purpose, if I
hadn&rsquo;t deeper reasons for conviction in the matter.&nbsp;
My proposal therefore is that you go back to the limits, further
cultivate the acquaintance of Miss Stone and find out as quickly
as possible for your own benefit as well as ours all you can
about her in that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond had risen.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think we may as well break
off all our connection right now, Mr. Gildersleeve,&rdquo; he
said coldly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am going back to the limits, but this
time let it be understood I&rsquo;m going on my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gildersleeve at a glance took in the determination written in
the young man&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see&mdash;I
see,&rdquo; he muttered significantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, in that
case, Mr. Hammond&mdash;can we expect you to respect our previous
confidences?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as it may be honourable and lawful to do so,
yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow Hammond sensed that reply rankled Gildersleeve, but
the latter responded, almost suavely: &ldquo;Very well then, call
around at Winch&rsquo;s office in the morning and there&rsquo;ll
be a cheque waiting you to cover payment for your services
according to our contract.&nbsp; Goodnight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held the door for Hammond to pass out.</p>

193</span>CHAPTER XVII<br />
OGIMA BUSH</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Strange</span> events took place on the
Nannabijou Limits during the morning of the day Hammond left by
tug for Kam City.</p>
<p>Josephine Stone arose early after a restless night of nervous
dread of she knew not what.&nbsp; There had been disturbing
incidents that had contributed to her trepidation.&nbsp; When she
had returned to the island after her fright at encountering the
Indian wizard, Ogima Bush, on the trail, she found Mrs. Johnson,
her companion, was absent.&nbsp; Inquiry of her Indian
woman-of-all-work, brought out fragmentary information that Mrs.
Johnson had left shortly after Miss Stone and Hammond had set out
on their trip up Nannabijou Hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men come in boat,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;and
big lady go way with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mary,&rdquo; insisted Miss Stone,
&ldquo;didn&rsquo;t she leave any message&mdash;didn&rsquo;t she
tell you any words to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe tell Mary&mdash;don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; They talk
fast.&nbsp; Walk fast.&nbsp; Go way fast&mdash;in put-put
boat.&nbsp; Maybe go some place big lady know, for she laugh and
look&mdash;glad.&nbsp; Mary think she say she not come back for
long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way did the boat go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian girl swung her arm to the west.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe
go to city, don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Johnson must have been sent for hurriedly.&nbsp; Most <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>likely she
had received an urgent message from her home in Calgary.&nbsp;
Something sudden must have happened, but Josephine Stone could
not imagine the considerate Mrs. Johnson leaving without an
explanation.&nbsp; She again frantically searched every possible
place in the cottage for sign of a note that she might have left
behind.&nbsp; There was none.</p>
<p>The messengers in the boat must have brought a telegram from
Calgary to her.&nbsp; Perhaps, in her excitement, she had
forgotten to leave a message of explanation.&nbsp; But just what
sort of news Mrs. Johnson could have received that would make her
laugh and &ldquo;look glad,&rdquo; as the Indian girl had said,
was more than she could imagine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; Miss Stone demanded, &ldquo;did you see
the men give Mrs. Johnson a piece of paper to read before she
left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe give piece of paper.&nbsp; Mary don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was utterly no use.&nbsp; The girl could tell her nothing,
and her brother Henry, who looked after the boats and cut the
wood when he was not engaged in the glorious Indian pursuit of
doing nothing, was even more stoically stupid.</p>
<p>After a night of fitful rest, when she had tried to compose
her mind that everything would turn out all right, she rose with
an ominous presentiment.&nbsp; Even after she had had breakfast
and had gone out for a short stroll around the island, the glory
of the autumn morning did not tend to dissipate her
depression.</p>
<p>As she was nearing the cottage door on her return, the white
glare of a large, bell-shaped military tent struck on the
clearing of a hill some distance south on the lake-shore caught
her attention.&nbsp; Soon picturesque figures appeared about the
tent&mdash;stalwart-looking chaps in scarlet tunics,
stiff-brimmed stetsons and dark trousers <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>with wide
gold braid stripes.&nbsp; She instantly recognised them as
Canadian mounted police and remembered that Acey Smith had said
the day previous that an outpost of the mounties would possibly
be stationed somewhere near Amethyst Island.</p>
<p>The young policemen were busying themselves about a small
camp-fire, evidently preparing an outdoor breakfast, their gay
chatter and outbursts of laughter ringing strangely clear on the
limpid morning air. . . .&nbsp; Then from out of the woods there
came a single soft stroke of the gong of Nannabijou.</p>
<p>The figures round the camp-fire stood one moment in silent
mystification; then, as if they had simultaneously made the
discovery, their gaze was turned on the figure of Josephine
Stone.&nbsp; One of the men focussed a field-glass upon her, and
the girl, embarrassed by the attention she was provoking, moved
back into the shelter of the trees.</p>
<p>She could not bear to return to the interior of the
cottage.&nbsp; An overpowering sense of an intangible something
out there in the woods had taken such a hold on her she quaked at
times as with the cold.&nbsp; It was as if unseen eyes watched
her every movement from the fastnesses; as though a designing,
hating presence prowled out there, always
watching&mdash;waiting.&nbsp; She could not entirely account for
the sensation.&nbsp; So far, she had never been afraid, alone as
she and Mrs. Johnson had been so far as white company was
concerned.&nbsp; Partly, of course, it came of her fright at the
unexpected meeting with Ogima Bush on the trail, the unexplained
departure of Mrs. Johnson and the urgent demand of Acey Smith
that she leave the island, because of an unnamed danger, until
the appointed time for meeting J.C.X.</p>
<p>J.C.X.!</p>
<p><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>The
very name now seemed to fill her with dread.&nbsp; Previously she
had pictured a dashing czar of the bush camps, handsome as he was
poetic by nature.&nbsp; At one time she had even suspected that
J.C.X. was none other than Acey Smith himself.&nbsp; Now she knew
that could not be the fact; she knew now that the timber boss of
the Nannabijou Limits, iron man though he was in other respects,
bent abjectly to the sinister influence and will of some powerful
factor he lived in constant dread of and dare not explain.&nbsp;
The remorse that had been in his tones when yesterday he had
spoken of &ldquo;the Man That Might Have Been&rdquo; had uttered
volumes as to the mental and spiritual shackles he had allowed to
be placed upon his better self.&nbsp; Why had he so
contemptuously referred to the tragic ending of the career of
Captain Carlstone?&nbsp; Had the gallant soldier also been vassal
to the grim J.C.X. and killed himself to escape his despair?</p>
<p>She now heartily wished she had never come to Amethyst
Island&mdash;that she had not pressed on Acey Smith to bring
about a meeting with J.C.X.&nbsp; If J.C.X. were a presentable
human being of sane and upright character, why was it not
possible for Acey Smith to induce him to come to meet her,
instead of asking her, an unprotected stranger, to journey she
knew not where to gain the information referred to in his
letter?&nbsp; True, she trusted Acey Smith so far as her personal
safety was concerned; her woman&rsquo;s intuition told her that,
away from the weird outside influence that seemed to dominate him
body and soul, he possessed the born instincts of a
gentleman&mdash;but, under its sway, it was problematical what he
might not be capable of doing.</p>
<p>That was one of the reasons she had refused to leave the
island for an undesignated destination without notifying any
one&mdash;the other was Louis Hammond.&nbsp; Louis Hammond would
surely come to-day&mdash;when she so <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>sorely needed him.&nbsp;
Instinctively her eyes searched the lakeshore trail in search of
a youthful, buoyant figure.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Josephine Stone was startled from her reverie by the parting
of the shrubbery down by the island shore.&nbsp; Five tall,
powerful-looking Indians sprang into view.</p>
<p>In the lead was a ghastly figure&mdash;the Indian Medicine Man
who had so startled her in the trail yesterday.</p>
<p>A face more sinister than his would be difficult to
conceive.&nbsp; Dark, almost to the blackness of an African, his
features bespoke evil cunning and a sense of power that was made
the more disconcerting by the livid red gashes on the cheek-bones
and by the brilliant jet-black eyes around which the whites
showed garishly.&nbsp; Straight, lank black hair fell to his
shoulders, where row upon row of glistening white wolves&rsquo;
teeth were arrayed.&nbsp; He wore no head adornment save a single
eagle&rsquo;s feather stuck in a band of purple at the back of
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry!&rdquo;&nbsp; Josephine Stone called to her
Indian man-of-all-work.&nbsp; The latter and his sister came out
of the house and took places by her side, but she could see they
were quaking with fear.</p>
<p>The quintette from the woods came to an abrupt halt before
them.&nbsp; For the moment Josephine Stone felt reassured on
noting they carried no arms.&nbsp; The weird figure in the
foreground bowed low, while his four companions stood motionless
as carved statues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful white lady,&rdquo; he addressed her in low,
guttural tones whose enunciation was perfect.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ogima
Bush, the Medicine Man, brings this message: It is the will of
Ogima&rsquo;s master that the white lady go from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her trepidation and bewilderment, Josephine Stone could
scarcely find words to reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>understand,&rdquo; she faltered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Am
I&mdash;ordered off this island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Medicine Man bowed again.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the will of
Ogima&rsquo;s master,&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;The white
lady is to go from here with Ogima.&nbsp; No harm will come to
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes flamed upon Henry and his sister standing by her
side, as he addressed them sharply; commands in the Objibiway
tongue that were like flying knife-blades.</p>
<p>Like galvanised automatons, Miss Stone&rsquo;s servants moved
away and marched down to the waterfront.</p>
<p>Their treacherous behaviour brought out the spirit of the
girl.&nbsp; For the moment, in her disgust, she forgot her own
perilous predicament.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cowards!&rdquo; she cried
after them, &ldquo;to be frightened by a cheap fakir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for you,&rdquo; and she turned her flashing eyes
upon the Medicine Man, &ldquo;go back and tell your master the
white lady says he can go&mdash;to the devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>White with anger she swayed, a beautiful figure of
defiance&mdash;a fragile white woman, alone, mocking a powerful
savage.&nbsp; The Medicine Man&rsquo;s head went up, his black
eyes gleaming admiration&mdash;and something else, something that
burned into her very soul in its ravishing masterfulness.&nbsp;
His lips parted and from them came a sibilant gasp.</p>
<p>Next instant he stepped forward; a swift, panther-like
movement.&nbsp; She sprang out of his grasp and swift as light
sped back through the cottage door.&nbsp; From a handbag just
inside she snatched out a small automatic.</p>
<p>She whirled the pistol into his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, you
get out of here,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;or
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;shoot to kill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ogima Bush paused.&nbsp; But instead of leaping back, he drew
himself to his full height and calmly folded his arms, the
faintest traces of a smile about his mouth as he looked down into
the muzzle of the deadly little gun.&nbsp; &ldquo;If wonderful
white lady shoot,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;she see a man
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>In
that moment, for all his wicked hideousness, the Indian was
magnificent.&nbsp; He was facing death, gambling on a one remote
chance that she could not thus deliberately slay him.</p>
<p>Josephine Stone hesitated, her finger trembling at the
trigger.&nbsp; She never exactly knew how it happened so quickly,
but in the winking of an eye the red man&rsquo;s left hand flew
out and closed over her wrist and fingers.&nbsp; The automatic
spat harmlessly past his cheek out into the open and was flung
from her hand to the floor.&nbsp; She felt herself whisked from
her feet as lightly as if she had been a child.&nbsp; She
scratched and tore at his face and throat impotently as he leaped
through the doorway and raced across the island to the beach.</p>
<p>Josephine Stone screamed and screamed again.&nbsp; He made no
attempt to stop her; his low, mocking laugh was her only
answer.&nbsp; But over his shoulder she saw that her cries had
had the desired result.&nbsp; Five mounted policemen standing in
astonishment by their tent on the hill up the lakeshore sprang
forward and tore down toward the island.</p>
<p>Ogima Bush with his burden stepped into the stern of a big
rowboat, and at his command two of his husky bucks bent over the
oars and made the craft fairly shoot across the intervening gap
to the mainland.&nbsp; The others of the party had apparently
crossed previously.</p>
<p>The bow of the boat was barely beached when Ogima Bush leaped
out into the shallow water with the girl.&nbsp; As if by magic
the Indian oarsmen disappeared into the curtain of the
woods.&nbsp; The Medicine Man followed, tearing through the trees
and dense growth as swiftly and skillfully as a flying moose, at
the same time protecting her so that not even a branch scratched
against her face or caught in her garments.</p>
<p>Far behind she could occasionally catch sounds of the <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>floundering
efforts of the pursuing policemen.&nbsp; Twice she tried to cry
out to attract their attention, but all her strength seemed to
have left her and it was all she could do to ward off a
swoon.&nbsp; He seemed to carry her with as great ease as he
might a babe, and she had to admit to herself with a certain
deference and respect.</p>
<p>The crashings of the policemen through the bush behind them
grew fainter and fainter and finally were lost in the
distance.</p>
<p>Presently Ogima Bush stepped out upon a winding man-wide
trail.&nbsp; He stood listening a moment, then gave vent to three
calls like a crow.&nbsp; An answering &ldquo;caw, caw, caw&rdquo;
came from the right just ahead.&nbsp; The Medicine Man plunged
forward.</p>
<p>Another turn brought them to what was to Josephine Stone more
familiar territory.&nbsp; They were on the trail that led across
Solomon Creek to the foot of the cliffs of Nannabijou.&nbsp; She
saw that they had come by a more difficult but much shorter route
than the one by which she and Louis Hammond had come up the day
previous.&nbsp; At the approach to the creek bridge four Indians
stepped out each holding a handle of a crude sedan built of poles
and cedar boughs.&nbsp; Muttering low commands in the Objibiway
tongue, the Medicine Man placed Josephine Stone on the cross-seat
fashioned between the two main poles.&nbsp; The girl recognised
the folly of offering further resistance to her captors; her only
resource now, she knew, was to await a strategic moment for
escape.&nbsp; At a grunt from Ogima Bush the carriers plunged
forward and across the bridge with their burden, the Medicine Man
striding behind them.</p>
<p>The young woman experienced a distinct sense of relief at
being free from the encircling arms of the grisly Indian.&nbsp;
She now had opportunity of scrutinising the four carriers.&nbsp;
They were not any of them the same <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>Indians as those who had accompanied
the Medicine Man to her cottage.&nbsp; Each of these men wore a
single eagle&rsquo;s feather in his hair, similar to the one
affected by the Medicine Man.&nbsp; The girl remembered that the
single feather was the insignia of chiefship and that no red man
save a witch doctor or headman of the tribe dared venture into
the zone of the Cup of Nannabijou, whose black cliffs frowned
menacingly upon her from above.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Josephine Stone&rsquo;s feelings were a mixture of wonder and
apprehension as the strange-looking party crossed Solomon Creek,
toiled up the trail and finally debouched into the passageway in
the cliffs that led to the tunnel she and Hammond had
visited.</p>
<p>In the interim she had time for cool reflection.&nbsp; Rescue
was for the present beyond question, away up in these wild hills,
and she knew any attempt on her part at escape would be equally
hopeless.&nbsp; It would be quite as futile to attempt to gain
information as to the object of her abduction from her sombre
captors.&nbsp; It suddenly struck her that her visit with Hammond
to the water-sealed entrance to the Cup of Nannabijou might have
had something to do with her present plight.&nbsp; She knew the
Indians looked upon the vicinity of the Cup as forbidden
ground.&nbsp; The priests of the mystic region might be
determined to have an explanation of the trespass, or worse
still, be intent on punishing the offenders.&nbsp; Acey
Smith&rsquo;s reference of the day before to an enemy whom he
seemed to fear might molest her during his absence recurred to
her.&nbsp; No doubt the superintendent had been well-intentioned
when he had insisted that she leave the island with him.&nbsp; He
might have had his own good reasons for being mysterious about
it, and now she had <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>ugly proof of a real danger he
probably had in mind.</p>
<p>Her reflections were cut short by the sudden entrance of the
party into the gloom of the tunnel, down which they carried her
carefully to the point where it opened out on the rocky brink of
the roaring mountain torrent.&nbsp; The bearers paused and let
the sedan down on the four short posts that served for
legs.&nbsp; Not one of them spoke or committed a motion.&nbsp;
She glanced backward.&nbsp; Had it not been for the blinking eyes
of the men behind her, they could have represented figures of
bronze.&nbsp; Ogima Bush had disappeared.</p>
<p>Her eyes were momentarily blinded by a wicked green flash of
light that illuminated the passageway, and with it came a deep
gonglike alarum from above.</p>
<p>There was a vibrating, thundering sound, and with its advent
the waters in the stream channel began to drop; dwindled swiftly
to a mere trickle and finally disappeared entirely except for the
moisture retained on the smooth-worn rock of its bed.</p>
<p>Amazement was still upon Josephine Stone when she heard Ogima
Bush utter a guttural command at her side.&nbsp; He had
reappeared as silently as he had dropped out of sight and now
walked with a firm hand to the side of the sedan as the bearers
carried it down the stone steps to the bed of the stream.</p>
<p>They moved only about fifty or sixty yards, around a very
abrupt curve, when they came to a stop opposite another short
flight of steps leading to a tunnel through the cliffs similar to
the one by which they had entered the stream-bed below.</p>
<p>Once in the tunnel, Ogima Bush again disappeared.&nbsp;
Josephine Stone heard the gonglike alarum, the roar of released
torrents, and the waters went sweeping down the channel they had
just emerged from.</p>
<p>Just how the stream was diverted from and returned <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>to the
portion of its course that formed a section of the passageway up
into the Cup she was curious to understand.&nbsp; She fancied
that a dam or shut-off was manipulated by some one in charge
above on signals sent by means of the gong.</p>
<p>In the weird novelty of it all the girl almost forgot her own
precarious situation; that she was the captive of a lawless
Indian magician, whose cunning, wicked face was an index of the
unscrupulous, ruthless soul that lay behind the black eyes whose
whites showed with such savage garishness.&nbsp; Furthermore, for
the moment, the fact that she knew nothing of whom she was to be
taken before or the fate that might await her had ceased to weigh
heavily upon her mind.&nbsp; The adventurous side of it and
curiosity to know what was the object of it all engrossed her
more.</p>
<p>With a suddenness that made her eyes wince they moved out from
the semi-gloom of the tunnel to the bright sunlight of the
open.</p>
<p>They were on the inside of the Cup of Nannabijou.</p>
<h2><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
IN THE CUP!</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Josephine Stone</span> gasped
involuntarily at the restful beauty of the scene that lay before
her.</p>
<p>It was like a bit of some fantastic fairyland cached away up
in the hills, surrounded on all sides as it was by what seemed an
unbroken and impregnable wall of black cliffs.</p>
<p>To her left and occupying almost half the area inside the Cup
right up to the cliffs back of her, where its overflow escaped
through a narrow opening, reposed a mountain lake like a
silver-grey mirror reflecting the walls of the Cup on the further
side in absolute clarity of detail.&nbsp; To the right, from the
point by which the party had entered, the land rose at a gentle
grade till it reached the foot of the walls of rock on that side
and the farther end possibly three-quarters of a mile away.&nbsp;
Back of the clear area of green sward at the lake-front was a
great forest of glistening white birch trees making a natural
background for a landscape picture indescribably perfect in the
dull gold of the morning sunlight.</p>
<p>But it was the vast green plot up which the carriers were
transporting her over a winding, gravelled walk, bordered to
either side with shrubs and small electric light standards such
as are used in city parks, that most amazed the young
woman.&nbsp; Miniature fountains, built of amethyst encrusted
rock, were set out here and there in little green
&ldquo;islands&rdquo; isolated by means of linked <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>circles
branching out at regular intervals from the main gravelled
path.</p>
<p>Before them, in the centre of the great lawn, stood a great
rambling building, constructed of unbarked cedar, with screened
verandahs and odd-looking little towers at its corners.&nbsp;
Some little distance from this ch&acirc;teau was a smaller
building and before it on high, white-painted poles were what
were unmistakably wireless a&euml;rials.&nbsp; Heavy copper wires
carried up on a series of poles from a point back in the opening
of the cliffs indicated that somewhere in the cascades formed by
the overflow of the lake a hydro-electric plant was located,
whence the current was brought for light and power to this
strange habitation in the heart of the wilderness.</p>
<p>Once Josephine Stone looked back into the face of Ogima
Bush.&nbsp; On the instant she thought she caught a quizzical,
amused expression on his swarthy visage, as though the Medicine
Man were actually enjoying her bewilderment.&nbsp; But his
features relapsed as quickly into the grim, stoical lines they
habitually held, so that only the wicked eyes above the livid red
gashes in his cheeks seemed alive and human.</p>
<p>As the party approached the ch&acirc;teau a plump, middle-aged
woman with a kindly, beaming face came out on the verandah and
down the steps to the walk.</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Johnson, Miss Stone&rsquo;s companion.</p>
<p>The Indians eased down the sedan, and, as Miss Stone stepped
out, quickly carried it away to the rear of the ch&acirc;teau,
Ogima Bush striding away with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josie!&rdquo; cried the elder woman as she embraced the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was really beginning to think something had
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bewildered, the girl looked into the face of her friend.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Happened?&rdquo; she echoed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should say
something <i>has</i> happened.&nbsp; I never dreamed of meeting
you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>&ldquo;Why Josie, dear, what&rsquo;s wrong?&nbsp;
Didn&rsquo;t you send word for me to come yesterday
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I send word?&nbsp; I never sent any such word: I
didn&rsquo;t know I was coming myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for the land&rsquo;s sake!&nbsp; They came after
you had gone away with Mr. Hammond yesterday morning and told me
you were moving right away back to a bungalow in the
mountain.&nbsp; Mr. Smith said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smith&mdash;the superintendent?&nbsp; Was he
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Josie.&nbsp; It was he who suggested that it
would much facilitate matters if I came here first to see that
the Indian help set the bungalow in order.&nbsp; He was awfully
nice about it, and they took me around the other side of the
point in his motorboat.&nbsp; Then the Indians carried me up in
that sedan to the entrance you came through to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was all Josephine Stone could say
for her pent-up indignation.&nbsp; So this was Acey Smith&rsquo;s
work!</p>
<p>She saw through it all now.&nbsp; He had thought she would
immediately accept his suggestion yesterday morning and come up
to this place; so sure had he been, that he had lured Mrs.
Johnson up here while she was out with Louis Hammond.&nbsp;
Then&mdash;then when she had refused unless he explained, he had
hired that hateful, horrible Indian and his band to carry her off
by force.&nbsp; When she next saw Acey Smith&mdash;well,
he&rsquo;d know a piece of her mind about it!</p>
<p>But the elder woman was proceeding: &ldquo;When the afternoon
passed and you didn&rsquo;t come, I began to feel worried, Josie,
until word was brought up by one of the Indians that you
couldn&rsquo;t come till this morning.&nbsp; I was a little
nervous in that big house all alone except for those Indians, but
they seemed ready to do everything for me and I kept the electric
lights going all night.&nbsp; Really, dear, it&rsquo;s a
wonderful place.&nbsp; Like something you&rsquo;d read <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>about in a
story-book&mdash;old, old furniture, great big rooms and huge
fire-places and wall mirrors.&nbsp; And away off in one wing is a
library full of queer books, and back of it again is a laboratory
such as scientists use.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s locked up and you
can see through the glass door that there&rsquo;s dust over
everything and it hasn&rsquo;t been used for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Josephine Stone was too exhausted by her exciting
morning&rsquo;s experience to talk, let alone go about exploring
the house.&nbsp; Her limbs seemed trembling under her as she
entered the door.&nbsp; The reaction of a sleepless night and the
events of the morning were commencing to tell on her.&nbsp; So,
directly after Mrs. Johnson had procured her a hot cup of tea,
she went direct to the room in the western end of the building
which the elder woman said had been set aside for her.&nbsp; She
flung herself on the bed without troubling to even take her shoes
off, and pulling the coverlet over her dropped off to sleep
immediately.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>It was two hours later&mdash;almost eleven
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;when she awoke, quite refreshed.&nbsp; There
was a light tapping at her chamber door.&nbsp; She leaped from
the bed, adjusted her rumpled hair by the glass and smoothed out
her skirt.&nbsp; She opened the door to find Mrs. Johnson in the
hall accompanied by two Indians bearing a hamper.&nbsp; The
Indians, at Mrs. Johnson&rsquo;s direction, carried the hamper
into the room and departed.</p>
<p>To her delight, Miss Stone found it to contain, neatly packed,
her wardrobe from the cottage at Amethyst Island as well as her
toilet articles and other personal effects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That awful-looking Indian and the two that just went
out brought it,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Johnson, which set <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>Josephine
Stone pondering over the sagacity which the wily Ogima Bush must
have employed to revisit the island and safely spirit away her
belongings under the very noses of the police.</p>
<p>While she was dressing, Miss Stone told the elder woman as
much as she thought it policy to tell her of the events in
connection with her forcible removal from Amethyst Island to the
Cup of Nannabijou.</p>
<p>Mrs. Johnson listened with growing amazement.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
had thought&mdash;in fact, I was sure&mdash;that it was an
arrangement between you and Mr. Smith,&rdquo; she gasped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I had no idea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was&mdash;in a way, pre-arranged,&rdquo; hastily
replied the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it was not entirely according
to what I had planned.&nbsp; Do you think there is any way we
could make our escape&mdash;at night, for instance&mdash;if we
found it necessary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Johnson shook her head emphatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
place is surrounded by an unscalable wall of cliffs,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are but two openings; the one you came
in where they turn the waters of the lake in by means of some
gate operated by electric power and another tunnel through the
cliffs down to the edge of Lake Superior on the northwestern
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t we get out the latter
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, Josie, it is merely a tunnel going down to the
edge of the big lake or an inlet from it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
way they get in their supplies for this place from the boats, but
the upper end is closed by great, heavy double doors which are
kept securely locked.&nbsp; They have some system of signals by
which the Indians here are notified when a boat docks at the
mouth of the tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t there any one in authority here besides
those Indians?&rdquo; insisted Miss Stone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
sure <a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>there are no other buildings in the Cup besides
these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are none that I have seen trace of, and I have
heard no one giving orders except that frightful Ogima
Bush.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; and Mrs. Johnson lowered her voice,
&ldquo;I <i>have</i> felt every hour I have been in this place
that there is some one or something one never sees or
hears&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her words were cut short by a hissing, crackling disturbance
that suddenly broke loose in the upper air outside.</p>
<p>Mrs. Johnson reassuringly placed a hand upon her
companion&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is only the wireless,
dear,&rdquo; she explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has sputtered away
like that a couple of times since I&rsquo;ve been here, but who
operates it, unless it be one of the Indians, I have not been
able to find out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I had almost forgotten to tell you,&rdquo; she
added suddenly, &ldquo;that hideous Indian Medicine Man seems to
be hanging around outside to see you about
something.&rdquo;&nbsp; She went to the window and peered
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone at last,&rdquo; she
observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had been waiting around out on the lawn
over there since he and the other two brought your
belongings.&nbsp; I asked him if there was any message he had to
leave; but he only made a noise in his throat like the snarl of a
wild beast and walked away.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>It was a few moments later that Josephine Stone, while walking
down to the shore of the little lake, was suddenly confronted by
Ogima Bush.</p>
<p>He bowed low, holding in an extended hand a folded note.</p>
<p>Wonderingly, the girl accepted the missive which was addressed
to her in a firm spencerian hand.&nbsp; When she had opened it
she read with amazement greater still:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Stone</span>:&mdash;This
is principally to set at rest any fears on your part as to your
personal safety.&nbsp; No harm can reach you where you are, and
at most you will not be asked to remain there for more than a few
days.</p>
<p>Believe me, it was not part of my plan that you should have
had to go through the disagreeable experience that befell you
this morning, which, for reasons I hope to be able to explain
later, I was unable to prevent without endangering your
interests.&nbsp; Circumstances promoted by others over whom I had
no control did that.</p>
<p>If there is any detail for your comfort or convenience which
may have been overlooked, please advise me.&nbsp; The bearer of
this note, Mr. Ogima Bush, is absolutely trustworthy so far as
the affairs of my friends are concerned.&nbsp; Mr. Bush will
therefore safely convey any message you may have for me before I
leave this afternoon for the east.&nbsp; Yours to command,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Acey
Smith</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You wait here.&rdquo; Josephine Stone addressed the
Indian, who stood with eyes averted to the gravel walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Un-n-n-n ugh,&rdquo; he gutturalled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ogima
wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurried back to the ch&acirc;teau and returned with a
pencil and some sheets of paper.&nbsp; Seating herself on a
little rustic bench, she three times started a reply to Acey
Smith&rsquo;s note, but each time failed to find words coldly
expressive of her contempt for the man who could knowingly allow
her to suffer the indignities she had met with that morning.</p>
<p>Finally she tore all the sheets into little shreds and flung
them angrily to the ground.&nbsp; Into the sinister face of the
Indian there came a look of actual apprehension as she arose from
the bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Mr. Smith I have no answer for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Medicine Man pointed to the torn bits of paper on the
walk.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe Ogima tell Big Boss white lady make
words many times and throw away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Stone&rsquo;s eyes were blazing as she stamped her <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>little foot
on the gravel.&nbsp; &ldquo;You tell him what I told you to tell
him&mdash;nothing more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Medicine Man quailed before the white wrath of the girl, a
ridiculous, crestfallen creature for the moment in his savage
trappings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Un-n-n-n, Ogima tell him what white lady
say&mdash;no more,&rdquo; he answered supinely with a hand above
his head as though to ward off an expected blow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Big
Boss maybe get heap mad; tell poor Ogima he lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he beats you within an inch of your
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian drew himself up to his full height at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hit Ogima Bush,&rdquo; he declared pompously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mister Smid Big Boss of camp; no boss of Ogima.&nbsp;
Un-n-n-n, Smid no boss Ogima!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; There was a wealth of biting sarcasm in
the girl&rsquo;s tones.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then who is Ogima&rsquo;s
boss, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ogima&rsquo;s boss same boss as Big Boss&mdash;same
boss as Mister Smid.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Indian was looking straight
down into her eyes.&nbsp; His wicked black optics softened in a
flash that transformed him, transfixed her with its
intensity.</p>
<p>He placed his right hand over his left breast as he said it in
tones scarcely above a sibilant whisper: &ldquo;<i>Ogima&rsquo;s
boss is J.C.X.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>With another low bow, the Medicine Man whirled on a
shoe-packed heel and strode swiftly away up the walk in the
direction of the water-locked gate of the Cup of Nannabijou.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the girl heard the gong in the cliffs
announce his departure.</p>
<h2><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>CHAPTER XIX<br />
&ldquo;DEVIL HE MAY BE-BUT A MAN!&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Louis Hammond went away from
the City Club after his conference with Norman T. Gildersleeve he
was convinced of two things.&nbsp; The one was that Gildersleeve
had not told him the entire truth.&nbsp; There had been a
furtiveness about the demeanour of Gildersleeve that irritated
Hammond: furthermore, there had been the acknowledged duplicity
of Winch in passing himself off as a United States consul, not to
mention Gildersleeve&rsquo;s veiled insinuations as to Josephine
Stone&rsquo;s connection with the North Star.&nbsp; To
Hammond&rsquo;s way of thinking, these and other elements of
Gildersleeve&rsquo;s methods did not &ldquo;hang&rdquo; very
well.&nbsp; The other conviction was that the North Star people
had been cognizant of Gildersleeve&rsquo;s plans from the very
first.&nbsp; There was now no doubt, in view of what had
happened, that Acey Smith, the pulp camp superintendent,
suspected, or perhaps knew definitely, from the night he landed
that he, Hammond, was identified with Gildersleeve and had been
sent out to the limits for the purpose of aiding in balking the
North Star&rsquo;s plans.&nbsp; That being so, either Acey Smith
had his own hidden objects in view in allowing Hammond the
freedom of the camp, or else&mdash;well, Hammond rather scouted
the idea that the Argus-eyed master of the Nannabijou Limits
considered him a nonentity in this conflict of wits who
wasn&rsquo;t worth troubling his head about.&nbsp; It
couldn&rsquo;t be that, he surmised, because Smith <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>was not the
type to overlook any possibilities of interference with his
plans.&nbsp; The deeper motive that he might have had in view
eluded Hammond&rsquo;s shrewdest deductions.&nbsp; Out in the
woods Acey Smith was playing at his own game, and more
experienced men than Hammond had failed to fathom him.&nbsp; Even
those most closely associated with him admitted they never
intimately understood this most inaccessible man of moods.</p>
<p>Anyway, Hammond felt immensely relieved to be free of all
responsibility to either of the contending companies, and, having
cashed Norman T. Gildersleeve&rsquo;s cheque in payment for his
services next day, he began planning a certain little affair of
his own.</p>
<p>He was unable to get passage out to the limits until noon, and
the trip was made on a cranky, wheezing little gasolene tug
manned by inexperienced seamen.</p>
<p>The tugmen&rsquo;s strike was on.&nbsp; Not only had all the
North Star seamen left their boats, but they had taken out with
them the crews of all the other towing and salvaging companies
between the Soo and the Head of the Lakes.&nbsp; It was rumoured
that the strike would next extend to the grain carriers and the
passenger and freight boats plying up and down the Great
Lakes.</p>
<p>The lumberjacks&rsquo; unions, however, had not yet called
their sympathetic strike.&nbsp; At the Nannabijou Limits Hammond
found things much the same as when he had left, except that there
seemed to be a large number of strange men prowling around the
camp, who, though they wore bush garb, were patently not North
Star men.&nbsp; At regular intervals, along the waterfront and
the roads leading up into the woods, armed members of the
Canadian Mounted Police were stationed, obviously for the
protection of property in case violence followed.</p>
<p>The lumberjacks were plainly in a sullen mood, especially the
foreigners, on whom the presence of the <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>uniformed
representatives of Canadian law and order produced an ugly
irritation.&nbsp; But, under the iron rule of Acey Smith, weapons
of any sort beyond the axes which the men used in their work were
strictly forbidden, so that an armed outbreak was out of the
question.</p>
<p>Hammond himself, on landing and producing his pass of
identification, was requested to step over to a little group of
police, where his pockets were lightly tapped to detect the
possible presence of concealed weapons.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorry to put
you to this bother, sir,&rdquo; smiled the officer in
charge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just a matter of form, you know.&nbsp;
Connected with the North Star Company, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the young man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
here on private business of my own, but I expect to be in camp
for a short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer gave him a sharp look as though committing his
face to memory.&nbsp; He seemed about to ask another question,
but instead nodded politely to signify the interview was
over.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Sandy Macdougal was enjoying his afternoon nod when Hammond
dropped in at their bunkhouse, but immediately after the
latter&rsquo;s entry the cook rolled out of the blankets in his
sock-feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cripes, didn&rsquo;t I lock that
door?&rdquo; he gasped as he sat blinking at the newcomer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Huh, guess I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; nerves, but the goings
on here lately is enough to make a man <i>loco</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what&rsquo;s up now, Sandy?&rdquo; laughed
Hammond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Place is alive with cut-throats,&rdquo; declared the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fellow has to sleep with one eye open to
watch that one of &rsquo;em don&rsquo;t come in to bean him for
his wad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I saw a lot of strangers about the camp,&rdquo;
observed Hammond.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are they anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gang of low-brow detectives and strike-breakers <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>brought in
from Winnipeg and Duluth on a towed barge early this
morning.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re the scum of creation, and the way
they gave orders to my boys when they came in for
eats&mdash;well, when Acey Smith comes back he&rsquo;ll have
another strike on his hands.&nbsp; My outfit didn&rsquo;t hire on
here to be bossed around by no second-class bums like
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the North Star&rsquo;s putting up a bluff of
breaking the strike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;North Star nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo; derided Sandy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If it was I wouldn&rsquo;t feel so cussed mean toward
them.&nbsp; This gang&rsquo;s been put in here by the other
company&mdash;the Kam City Pulp and Paper Mill crowd&mdash;to
take hold of the camp work if the North Star&rsquo;s pole-cutters
and boom-tenders go out in sympathy with the tugmen.&nbsp; Mooney
put me wise, and you bet we make &rsquo;em whack up for every
meal they get here at rates just the same as if they was
stoppin&rsquo; at the Royal Aleck in Winnipeg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond whistled.&nbsp; &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the idea,
eh?&rdquo;&nbsp; He had to concede to himself that Gildersleeve
must have acted with considerable despatch.&nbsp; No doubt he
intended to use these men for waterfront land work when he got
his tugs over from Duluth to convey the poles to Kam City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to come very much, at
that,&rdquo; insisted Macdougal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Any old time this
strike is settled it will be settled by the North Star
itself&mdash;and it won&rsquo;t be settled till then, not if they
bring all the strikebreakers and mounties between here and
hell&rsquo;s gangway to the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think the North Star has the upper hand in this
deal, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macdougal fished out his black bottle and insisted on Hammond
having a &ldquo;nip&rdquo; with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;If they
ain&rsquo;t got the upper hand right now,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;they will have <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>it when the shuffle&rsquo;s
over.&nbsp; There ain&rsquo;t any outsider can come in here and
put it over Acey Smith. . . .&nbsp; And believe me, whatever is
his game, I&rsquo;m one who wants to see the Big Boss win.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deep underlying note in Sandy&rsquo;s tones made Hammond
gaze at him fixedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You used to say, Sandy, that he
was the king of crooks,&rdquo; he reminded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You used
to say, in fact, that Acey Smith was a devil in human
form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crook he may be and devil too,&rdquo; conceded the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m with him because&mdash;&rdquo;
and Sandy smote a nearby bench with his
fist,&mdash;&ldquo;because he&rsquo;s a man!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s one
of them kind of men that if the whole world was jumpin&rsquo; at
his throat he&rsquo;d put his back again&rsquo; a rock and fight
it out without askin&rsquo; help or sob-stuff from any of
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; And he&rsquo;d go down grinnin&rsquo; that
little devil-grin o&rsquo; his and tellin&rsquo; them all to go
to hell and be damned to them&mdash;that&rsquo;s the kind of a
man the Big Boss is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond did not smile at this unexpected outburst of
hero-worship.&nbsp; The little Scotch-Canadian was so emotionally
intense about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Hammond,&rdquo; he was saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Big Boss likely is as black a rascal as they say he is, and
that&rsquo;s a whole lot; but he never fights the weak or the
poor.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t I seen what he&rsquo;s done unbeknownst
to most for unfortunates in this camp?&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t I been
in the city when I seen him stop on the street to help a blind
bum over a dangerous crossin&rsquo; when everybody else was
hustlin&rsquo; by and lookin&rsquo; the other way so they
wouldn&rsquo;t see their duty?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t I know that in
the hard times six years ago it was this same Acey Smith who
bought up a row of shacks in the coal docks district where the
landlords was dumpin&rsquo; whole families out because they had
nothin&rsquo; to pay them with, and don&rsquo;t I know that none
of them has ever paid since when they was hard up?&nbsp; I know
<a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>because
it was one of my side jobs to look after them houses and see that
the taxes was paid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I could tell you lots of other things about
the Big Boss that would be just as hard to believe,&rdquo; the
cook went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose you never heard about the case
of that Frompton girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other matters were uppermost in Hammond&rsquo;s mind, but he
knew there was no stopping Sandy when the talking mood was on
him, so he said good-naturedly: &ldquo;No, Sandy, tell us the
story.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>&ldquo;That all happened in the days before the war when the
Big Boss was feelin&rsquo; a lot more cocky than he seems to be
nowadays,&rdquo; began the cook.&nbsp; &ldquo;This Frompton girl,
who was a waitress in one of the city eatin&rsquo; houses, was
something of a good looker, but it seems that down east
she&rsquo;d had a nasty bit of past, mostly some low
skunk&rsquo;s fault who deceived her and skipped out
leavin&rsquo; her to face it alone.&nbsp; After her baby, maybe
lucky for its poor little self, died, her and her mother came up
to Kam City where nobody knew them.&nbsp; But scandal like that,
especially if it&rsquo;s about a woman, will travel.&nbsp; One
night a young blood, a son of one of the wealthy ginks in the
town, being a little worse of bootleg, tried to get fresh with
her, and the hot-tempered little thing hauls off and biffs him in
the face.&nbsp; The poor prune wasn&rsquo;t man enough to take
his medicine, but bawls her out with some dirty remark about what
she&rsquo;d been in the town she&rsquo;d come from.&nbsp; I guess
she got seein&rsquo; red over that, for she picked up a catsup
bottle and bashed him on the head with it.&nbsp; The rich
man&rsquo;s son came near kickin&rsquo; the bucket from that
clout, and, as it was, he was a month or so in the hospital
before they were sure he&rsquo;d pull <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>through.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t
pull the girl up for attackin&rsquo; him, because his family
didn&rsquo;t want the notoriety; but she was held in jail on a
charge of disorderly conduct till they&rsquo;d see what would
happen to him.&nbsp; Then, if he lived, they intended to bring
her before the magistrate and get her packed off to a reformatory
as an example of what happens to bad girls who beat up rich
men&rsquo;s sons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I happened to know some of the crowd that was
mixed up in the rumpus and had been followin&rsquo; the
case.&nbsp; One night when the Big Boss was in the dinin&rsquo;
camp havin&rsquo; supper I threw down the paper and started to
cuss.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks over at me and asks: &lsquo;Why all the sweet
language, Macdougal?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I starts in and tells him all about the case and how I
thought the world was all wrong that nobody would lift a finger
to help out a poor, fallen woman like this one.&nbsp; He listened
with a lot more interest than you can generally get out of him,
and I wound up by sayin&rsquo;, &lsquo;Cripes, what&rsquo;s all
the preachers for that they don&rsquo;t start in scorin&rsquo;
the guilty parties instead of standin&rsquo; by while everybody
pans the girl?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The preachers ain&rsquo;t to blame,
Sandy,&rsquo; he comes back.&nbsp; &lsquo;Most of the preachers
go as far as they dare in settin&rsquo; the world right, and
every once in awhile you read about some of the darin&rsquo; ones
being bumped out of their pulpits for speakin&rsquo; their
minds.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then his face gets chalk-white like you see
it when he&rsquo;s mad.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s this system they
call Society needs fixin&rsquo;, Sandy,&rsquo; he sneers.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Society that just wants to use the law and the preachers
to keep its chosen crowd out of jail in this world and out of
hell in the next.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of him, the king of the big timber crooks,
a-talkin&rsquo; this way.&nbsp; But that was just like
him&mdash;always contrary to everybody else.</p>
<p><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Macdougal,&rsquo; says he suddenly,
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t you wish you was a great lawyer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; I asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;you could defend
this girl before the court and maybe cheat the thing they call
the Law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I never thought of that,&rsquo; I replied, but I
could see there was something comin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little devil-grin flickers around the Big
Boss&rsquo;s poker face that&rsquo;s always there when he&rsquo;s
plannin&rsquo; hellery.&nbsp; &lsquo;We ain&rsquo;t lawyers,
Macdougal,&rsquo; he states, &lsquo;but I know where the money
can be found to hire the best sob-stirrin&rsquo; lawyer in Kam
City, and if he gets her clear there&rsquo;ll be a bonus of a
couple of hundred in it for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew what that meant.&nbsp; I had wished myself into
the job of hirin&rsquo; the lawyer and seein&rsquo; that he got
the money on the quiet.&nbsp; Acey Smith outlines how I am to go
about the deal and says: &lsquo;If the lawyer gets her off,
we&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t get a job for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make a long story short we got Jacobs, the best
lawyer on them sort of cases in Kam City, and he puts up such a
talk for her, a-quotin&rsquo; Scripture and so on, that he had
everybody in the courtroom except the district crown attorney
wipin&rsquo; the corners of their eyes.&nbsp; He winds up by
statin&rsquo; there was a party who was prepared to start her off
fresh on a decent job.&nbsp; The old magistrate was so taken with
Jacob&rsquo;s speil he said he thought she hadn&rsquo;t had a
chance, and, after a lecture to her on the straight and narrow
path, he lets her off without even the suspended sentence the
crown attorney tried to horn in with as a last resort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Jacobs turned the girl and her mother loose on
me when they insisted on thanking the man who&rsquo;d put up the
money to defend her, and in a weak moment, bein&rsquo; kind of
flustered, I promised to take them to him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never
forget what happened when I took them out <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>to the old
camp layout on the tug.&nbsp; As I said, the girl was rather a
good-lookin&rsquo; kid and she hadn&rsquo;t commenced to get that
hard jib women who go under seem to take on.&nbsp; She seemed
still kind of dazed over it all when I walked her and her mother
into the superintendent&rsquo;s office.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the man,&rsquo; says I before I had yet
thought just what I was doing.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the man
you can thank for savin&rsquo; you from the clink.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Big Boss he scowls at me as black as thunder and I
knew I&rsquo;d put my foot in it for fair, but the girl breaks
down and falls at his feet, a-sobbin&rsquo; that she wasn&rsquo;t
worth savin&rsquo;.&nbsp; In sort of hysterics she was.&nbsp; For
once the Big Boss seemed like he didn&rsquo;t know what to
do.&nbsp; He looked around wild-eyed as though he&rsquo;d like to
beat it out the door.&nbsp; But he couldn&rsquo;t, because in her
little cryin&rsquo; fit she&rsquo;d taken a strangle hold on his
boots.&nbsp; So he lifts her up and chucks her into her
mother&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get up, girl,&rsquo; he cries kind of hoarse and
bashful-like.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t your judge, and if
you&rsquo;ve done any wrong I don&rsquo;t know anything about it
and don&rsquo;t want to.&nbsp; The North Star&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;
to offer you a job, and Macdougal here has the lookin&rsquo;
after of that.&nbsp; Go straight, girl,&rsquo; he adds,
fixin&rsquo; her with them flashin&rsquo; coal-black eyes of his,
&lsquo;and if any one throws this thing up at you again let us
know about it and there&rsquo;ll be little old hell to
pay!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he packs us back on the next tug with orders where
she was to look for the job.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t in a North
Star office, but one of the other factories in town that people
say is run with North Star money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think there wasn&rsquo;t a
curtain-call for me when I got back to camp for givin&rsquo; away
to the girl and her mother as to the man whackin&rsquo; up for
her lawyer.&nbsp; The Big Boss nearly fired me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know me, Macdougal,&rsquo; he
grits.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t a movin&rsquo; picture hero
such as you seem to think.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>I tell you
we were in on this thing just for the fun of cheatin&rsquo; the
law?&nbsp; Besides, it wasn&rsquo;t my money but the North
Star&rsquo;s that paid for her lawyer, and it was the North
Star&rsquo;s influence that got her that job, just the same as
the North Star has rescued other people from the clutches of the
law that it knew it could use.&nbsp; That girl&rsquo;s one of us
now and she&rsquo;d go through hell-fire in the company&rsquo;s
interests if she was asked to.&nbsp; If you wasn&rsquo;t blind
you&rsquo;d have seen that from the first.&nbsp; Beat it to your
beanery and don&rsquo;t let me ever hear you mention a word about
this again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, he&rsquo;s a queer, queer man, is Acey
Smith,&rdquo; concluded the cook.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sometimes it seems
to me something is eatin&rsquo; the heart out of
him&mdash;something burnin&rsquo; inside him and fillin&rsquo;
him up with hellery.&nbsp; Sometimes I think he&rsquo;s a good
man with a devil in him that won&rsquo;t give him no
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook&rsquo;s story, like others he had heard, impressed
Hammond even if it did increase the enigma that hung about the
personality of the timber boss.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is certain he has
some fixed method in all this madness of his,&rdquo; Hammond
mused as much to himself as to his companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;One
object undoubtedly is to keep every one guessing what his real
motives are.&nbsp; He has to keep himself pretty much a mystery
in order to carry out the orders of his bosses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but he ain&rsquo;t carryin&rsquo; out their crooked
work just for the money there&rsquo;s in it,&rdquo; spoke up
Macdougal.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something deeper&rsquo;n
that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been a-studyin&rsquo; the man too close
and too long to believe that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s something inside
the man himself that makes him carry on as he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll quite agree with you there,&rdquo; responded
Hammond.&nbsp; &ldquo;You call it a devil while I would call it
an obsession of mind or a ruling mania: all of which are <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>pretty much
the one and the same thing, except that our forefathers called it
a devil and let it go at that.&nbsp; If one could only get the
key to that obsession they&rsquo;d soon be able to clear up the
whole mystery of this camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, Hammond, if you <i>could</i> get the key,&rdquo;
observed the cook, &ldquo;but Acey Smith is canny enough to keep
that key locked up in a dark place that nobody knows but
him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>CHAPTER XX<br />
PREPARING TO BEARD THE LION</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To</span> my mind,&rdquo; continued
the cook, &ldquo;that same key has got something to do with them
big booms of poles lyin&rsquo; out there in the bay waitin&rsquo;
to be delivered to the Kam City Pulp and Paper Mills.&nbsp;
Puttin&rsquo; one and two together I could see the drift of
things so far as the strike is concerned if it wasn&rsquo;t for
all the queer side issues, includin&rsquo; that pretty girl that
was stoppin&rsquo; out on Amethyst Island.&nbsp; What was the
idea of her whiskin&rsquo; out of there the way she
did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond gasped.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then&mdash;then she <i>has</i>
left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you knew all about it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sandy
Macdougal scrutinised his companion almost suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, Sandy, I&rsquo;m in the dark.&nbsp; The last
time I saw Miss Stone she said nothing about any plans for
leaving in the near future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be jiggered!&nbsp; Why man, she left
there the morning of the day you went to Kam City.&nbsp; She was
supposed to have been carried off by a gang of Indians,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo;&nbsp; Hammond in his
excitement leaped up seizing the other by the collar.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are you joking, or is this the truth you&rsquo;re telling
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your horses, hold your horses!&rdquo; urged the
cook.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you what was supposed
to have happened&mdash;what the mounties claim they saw.&nbsp;
You knew they had <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>arrested the Rev. Stubbs, the camp preacher, for
takin&rsquo; part in it, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re away off again, Sandy; they arrested him
on a charge of vagrancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vagrancy my eye!&nbsp; That was only a charge to hold
him on until they could get the goods on him for takin&rsquo;
part in the abduction of the girl, and I heard since that Stubbs
got bail over in Kam City and jumped it.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m one
that ain&rsquo;t takin&rsquo; much stock in that abduction
talk,&rdquo; continued the cook.&nbsp; &ldquo;For one thing, the
Big Boss and that girl was on friendly terms; in fact, he was the
first one she came to see after she landed out here, and
it&rsquo;s known he used to go out and see her on the island when
you weren&rsquo;t busy takin&rsquo; up her time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
cook grinned maliciously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it
looks mighty odd that, knowin&rsquo;, as he must have knowed,
that she was carried off like that, the Big Boss would leave for
Montreal without botherin&rsquo; his head about it?&nbsp; No,
that ain&rsquo;t a bit like Acey Smith from what I know of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the whole deal was a frame-up between her and the
Big Boss to keep the Mounted Police busy on a false scent and to
mystify everybody else that&rsquo;s tryin&rsquo; to find out what
the North Star&rsquo;s up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t, eh?&nbsp; Well, have you got a
better hunch?&nbsp; Bein&rsquo; a bit soft on the girl maybe has
made you short-sighted.&nbsp; Hold on, don&rsquo;t get mad; I
don&rsquo;t blame you a bit, &rsquo;cause they tell me
she&rsquo;s some lallapaluza for good looks.&nbsp; And I
ain&rsquo;t meanin&rsquo; to cast any reflections on her in this
deal either.&nbsp; Only, I like you, Hammond, and I wanted to
help you out with my hunch if it was any good to you, just in
case some of the rest of them was puttin&rsquo; something over on
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond for the moment was silent in the face of <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>these
assertions.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t for the life of me
see,&rdquo; he mused presently, &ldquo;how Rev. Stubbs was mixed
up in it as you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sandy threw out his hands
significantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;For another thing, did you know that
since the girl was supposed to be kidnapped and the Rev. Stubbs
was arrested, his nibs, Ogima Bush the Medicine Man, has dropped
out of sight too?&nbsp; He hasn&rsquo;t been seen anywhere inside
or outside the camps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might easily be,&rdquo; discounted Hammond.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Medicine Man was always erratic in his comings and
goings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t think the girl was a party to the
kidnappin&rsquo; frame-up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I certainly do not!&rdquo;&nbsp; There came a
warning glint into Hammond&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I say
that because I know Miss Stone would not willingly be a party to
a crooked deal put up by Acey Smith or any one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, then what happened her and where is she
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a theory where she&rsquo;s been taken,
and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to set about proving right
away.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hammond rose and strode to the door.&nbsp; At
the threshold he turned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sandy,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully much obliged to you for this little
chat, and I think you&rsquo;ve helped me a whole lot with the
problem.&nbsp; In a couple of days&rsquo; time I think I&rsquo;ll
be able to get at the bottom of this whole mystery, or
else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or else what?&rdquo; insisted the cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or else I&rsquo;m going to the mat with Acey Smith and
choke the truth out of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook rose to offer some better advice, but Hammond flung
out the door and hurried down to the waterfront.</p>
<h3><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>II</h3>
<p>Hammond went direct to the tent occupied by Inspector Little,
the officer in command of the Mounties.&nbsp; The Inspector was
busy with one of the members of his force going over some
papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to trouble you, Inspector,&rdquo; opened Hammond,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to make an appointment to meet you
privately on a confidential matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inspector turned the papers he was examining face
downwards on the little camp table and looked up.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
it is an important matter,&rdquo; he suggested crisply, &ldquo;we
may as well deal with it at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> quite important,&rdquo; Hammond assured
him.</p>
<p>Inspector Little turned to his aide.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may go,
Sergeant,&rdquo; he indicated.</p>
<p>Alone with the officer, Hammond briefly explained that he was
a personal friend of the young lady, Miss Josephine Stone, who
had been carried away by force from Amethyst Island, and he had
come to offer his services in helping to locate her.&nbsp; He
added that he had a theory where she could be found and was ready
to start on an expedition by himself to locate her once he had
gained the necessary permission of the police.&nbsp; He briefly
referred to the arrest of Rev. Nathan Stubbs and the rumour that
he was suspected of being a party to the abduction.&nbsp; He said
nothing, however, about his knowledge that the fake preacher was
really a detective in the employ of Norman T. Gildersleeve,
fearing such a statement would lead him into complications that
would only delay the expedition he had in mind.&nbsp; He did
express the opinion that the camp preacher could have had no part
in the abduction.</p>
<p>The inspector stared at him fixedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
particular <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>grounds have you for that last statement, Mr.
Hammond?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for one thing he was down here at the dock at
noon when I left that day.&nbsp; I scarcely see how he could have
got back here so soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Stubbs&rsquo; own contention when we quizzed
him about it.&nbsp; So we arrested him on a nominal charge of
vagrancy to hold him on suspicion of being implicated in the
abduction.&nbsp; In the first place,&rdquo; argued the officer,
&ldquo;if he were innocent, why should he jump one thousand
dollars bail put up by his lawyer through mysterious
friends?&nbsp; With much less than a thousand dollars he could
have cleared himself of the vagrancy charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond knew the very important reason Norman T. Gildersleeve
had for getting the pseudo preacher out of the awkward position
his continued incarceration would have brought about, but he
cautiously held silence on that point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had, as a matter of fact, very good grounds for
suspecting Stubbs of not only being implicated but of being the
ring-leader in the abduction of the young lady,&rdquo; Inspector
Little continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he was actually seen taking part in the
abduction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disguised, yes,&rdquo; enlightened the inspector.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There has been something altogether queer going on in
these camps for some time as you likely know from your own
experiences, and I have no doubt the carrying off of Miss Stone
is but a side issue of some intrigue on foot between these rival
lumbermen.&nbsp; One or the other of the companies concerned must
have put up Stubbs&rsquo; bail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, I have to admit that suspicion first fell upon
the camp preacher through some chance remarks on the part of Mr.
A. C. Smith, the superintendent, on <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>the very morning the affair took
place.&nbsp; Mr. Smith came down to my tent early to ask me to go
up and have breakfast with him and to inquire if there were
anything he or any of his men could do to help us out in getting
settled.&nbsp; A mighty charming and interesting chap that man
Smith for all his enemies say about him, and he has at least
shown us every courtesy since we&rsquo;ve been here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when we were just about to leave for the dining
camp he whirled and asked me a remarkable question.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Did you ever know of one man successfully impersonating
two different characters in life, Inspector Little?&rsquo; He put
it with that odd little smile of his&mdash;a sort of whimsical
grin that makes you think he&rsquo;s reading your answer before
you utter it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I answered in a spirit of banter,
&lsquo;there was Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, for instance, and
I&rsquo;ve known certain actors on the stage who did it pretty
smartly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he seemed to be serious about it.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have reason to suspect such a dual role is being played in real
life on these limits,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; Then he asked:
&lsquo;Did you closely observe that camp preacher, Rev. Nathan
Stubbs, who was down around the docks here a little while
ago?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I did,&rsquo; I answered, for it is part of our
business to take sharp note of all strange characters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And you looked over the Indian Medicine Man they
call Ogima Bush who was around here when you were putting up your
tents late yesterday afternoon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him I had, wondering all the time what he was
coming to.&nbsp; Then he asked me if I had noted a peculiarity
about both their eyes; that, while the Indian had two little
wounds either painted or gashed under his, the camp preacher had
talcum or some other powder thickly spread over what seemed to be
tiny scars in the same places on his face.</p>
<p><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;By Jove,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;now
that you mention it, I have noticed that, and though their
clothing, colour of skin and get-up is different, they are about
the one height and build.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And they are both mysteries,&rsquo; he
supplemented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Harmless fakirs, though?&rsquo; I hazarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If they were,&rsquo; he replied briskly,
&lsquo;or rather if I were sure they were, I wouldn&rsquo;t take
up your time about the matter.&nbsp; I am convinced, Inspector,
that they are both <i>very dangerous characters</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His tone of conviction impressed me.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
you feel certain it is one man playing two r&ocirc;les?&rsquo; I
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not saying that,&rsquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;But the fact that you have noted the same
facial peculiarity in those two characters gives me an idea which
is further strengthened by the circumstance that no one has seen
the two of them about any part of the camps at the same
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thereupon suggested that if he, as superintendent of
the camps, requested it we could arrest the party on a charge of
vagrancy while he was playing either r&ocirc;le and thus get at
the bottom of the thing.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, I added, I
would much favour keeping a close watch on the actions of both
Ogima Bush and Rev. Nathan Stubbs until such time as there
appeared to be more definite grounds for making an arrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That would be much the better plan,
Inspector,&rsquo; he approved.&nbsp; &lsquo;As I am going away
from camp for a few days I thought I would at least draw your
attention to the circumstances, and, in case there might be some
mischief afoot behind this apparent masquerading, you could be on
the lookout for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thanked him and the subject was not again mentioned
during our conversation.&nbsp; That very morning, and it must
have been a short time after our talk, Miss <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>Stone was
forcibly carried off by a band of Indians headed by the Medicine
Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond sat bolt upright at this information, but he
suppressed comment while the inspector proceeded.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It was not until the patrol down at Amethyst Island
waterfront had exhausted every effort to run down the abductors
of the young lady and failed that they sent in a report to
us.&nbsp; The result was that we didn&rsquo;t hear of it until
after dinner.&nbsp; The preacher was in the camp, seemingly quite
confident that his disguise was impenetrable.&nbsp; His surprise
when the handcuffs were slipped onto him was good enough to be
genuine.&nbsp; Sure enough though when a handkerchief was applied
to the paste and talc powder on his cheek bones it disclosed two
tiny white scars under either eye in the self-same spots where
the Indian had the red gashes, not to mention the false beard
which we left on his face for the time being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond sat dumbfounded at this recital.&nbsp; Those tiny
white scars under each eye!&nbsp; Gildersleeve was the only white
man he had ever seen with such peculiar marks.&nbsp; So&mdash;so
Gildersleeve had really played the part of the camp preacher
himself?&nbsp; That much was patent now, and there seemed every
circumstantial incident to imply that he was also Ogima Bush,
though Hammond could scarcely conceive that any make-up could
transform a white man into such a thorough-going savage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest of the story is likely familiar to you, Mr.
Hammond,&rdquo; the inspector was proceeding.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know how Stubbs was arraigned in Kam City on a charge of
vagrancy, bailed out by friends and immediately
disappeared.&nbsp; It is all a mighty queer mix-up that stands in
need of thorough investigation, but,&rdquo; with a wave of <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>the hand
and a raising of the brows, &ldquo;the Mounted force were sent
out here to protect property and maintain law and order in case
of a strike, and without a shadow of a clue to work on it&rsquo;s
pretty difficult getting on the trail of the principals behind
the outrage on Amethyst Island.&nbsp; Now, if you have any
additional facts that would be of use to us, or can give us
tangible help of any sort in locating Miss Stone, we will
certainly be glad to avail ourselves of your
assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond was incensed at the evident duplicity of
Gildersleeve.&nbsp; But at the same time he was tired of
theorising, and of attempting to unravel the puzzles which
Nannabijou Camp confronted him with almost daily since he had
first arrived there.&nbsp; So he thrust aside the temptation to
enlighten the head of the Mounties on what he knew of the part
Gildersleeve must have played.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I had a theory as to where Miss Stone has
been carried off,&rdquo; he reminded the inspector.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As a matter of fact, I am certain she has been taken up
into a hiding-place in the Cup of Nannabijou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;up above those cliffs on the hill?&nbsp;
Why, man, our chaps say there&rsquo;s no opening in that wall of
cliffs and they are unscalable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are popularly believed to be so,&rdquo; replied
Hammond, &ldquo;but it is a fact that there are parties who make
a headquarters of some sort up there, and they have a secret
entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;&nbsp; The inspector pursed his moustached
mouth in polite skepticism.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know how they get in
and out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for certain, but I do know a better and a quicker
method.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The air route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;mph.&rdquo;&nbsp; The inspector evinced a
sudden interest.&nbsp; <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>&ldquo;Yes, that <i>would</i> be
practical for scouring the whole country back of here.&nbsp; But
where are you going to get an airplane and an airman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an old scouting single-seater in Kam City
in fairly good shape.&nbsp; I happened to see it in the armouries
while I was rambling around the city a couple of days before I
first came out here.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the property of the
government.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I came to you; as head of the
Mounted Police you could no doubt induce the government
authorities to lend us the machine for this purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your airman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer Hammond threw back the lapel of his coat displaying
the airman&rsquo;s wings which he modestly wore over his left
vest-pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can take care of that part of
it,&rdquo; he suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw three years&rsquo;
hard work in the air overseas, two years of which I put in
playing tag with Fritz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough!&rdquo;&nbsp; Proof that Hammond had been a
fighting airman seemed to dissipate the inspector&rsquo;s last
doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no harm in giving this thing a
try,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;and by Jove, we&rsquo;ll get busy
right off.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll send you over to Kam City in one of
the police motorboats to-morrow morning.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give
you a wire to file to Major Lynn at Ottawa, and he&rsquo;ll get
things through for us without unnecessary red tape.&nbsp; But
look you, Hammond, when you go up to the Cup you have only
instructions to look around, get the lay of the land and come
right back here to me.&nbsp; Then we&rsquo;ll act!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inspector glanced at his watch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, by the
way,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve some confounded
routine to look after that will keep me busy for the best part of
a couple of hours.&nbsp; But after tea drop in for an hour or <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>so, old
chap, and we&rsquo;ll have a pipe and talk over the details of
this thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hammond went away highly elated.&nbsp; At last he was to get a
real chance to do some active work in ferreting out the mystery
of the Nannabijou Limits, and&mdash;he fervently hoped&mdash;to
meet again Josephine Stone, the girl with the high-arched
eyebrows, and the woman of his dreams.</p>

A VIPER BITES AT A FILE</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>There was unwonted stir in the Montreal head offices of the
Regal Bank of Canada.&nbsp; Rarely in the metropolitan
headquarters of the Dominion&rsquo;s greatest financial
institution, where the comings and goings of important personages
are almost hourly occurrences, did the entrance of a visitor draw
more than a hurried glance from the workers behind the polished
mahogany and lacquered brass.&nbsp; The man who had just come
through the great double doors was no ordinary type.</p>
<p>He seemed like a being detached from his fellows; like them
but not of them, indifferent, masterful.&nbsp; Tall and of superb
build, his close-fitting dark clothes and light fedora
accentuated the pallor of his coldly-chiselled aquiline features
and the blackness of his extraordinary eyes.&nbsp; His every item
of dress&mdash;his tie with the tiny, scintillating white diamond
pin, his white cuffs just peeping from the sleeves, his
shoes&mdash;had a distinctive correctness.&nbsp; But his carriage
was of the easy, confident grace of one more used to the wide
spaces of the North than the over-heated drawing-rooms of the
East.&nbsp; He evidently scorned a walking-stick, for in his
long, capable-looking hands he carried only his gloves and a
black travelling-bag.</p>
<p>Young women clerks glanced up from their tasks to stare
pensively at the stranger.&nbsp; Young men bit enviously at their
nether lips as they mentally conceded the <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>physical
perfection of the visitor.&nbsp; There were whispered
<i>asides</i>.&nbsp; It seemed he was not altogether unknown
among the older members of the staff.</p>
<p>The newcomer went direct to the quarters of the bank&rsquo;s
president.&nbsp; In the outer office the president&rsquo;s
secretary rose deferentially and opened the door to the inner
sanctum.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir David will see you at once, Mr.
Smith,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>A lean grey man with alert grey eyes and a drooping grey
moustache arose and proffered his hand across the glass-topped
desk.&nbsp; &ldquo;We received your wire and were expecting you,
Mr. Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was glad to find you were not out of town, Sir
David,&rdquo; returned the other, &ldquo;for the matter I wish to
see you about is rather pressing and important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you favour us with one of your rare personal calls
it usually is so,&rdquo; smilingly reminded the banker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, nevertheless,&rdquo; insisted Acey Smith,
&ldquo;it may prove more than an ordinary surprise for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And an hour and a half later when Sir David Edwards-Jones,
president of the Regal Bank of Canada, had gone over the papers
and documents in the black grip with Acey Smith and their
business interview was ended, the perplexity that sat upon his
usually imperturbable features was proof of the other&rsquo;s
prediction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wishes shall be carried out to the letter, Mr.
Smith,&rdquo; he promised.&nbsp; &ldquo;The legality of the
transaction cannot be questioned.&nbsp; Your financial
stewardship of the affairs of the other party has been
scrupulously above any criticism and we nor any other concerned
have any option but to be guided by your commands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; he added with a puzzled smile,
&ldquo;that the methods of your company have always baffled me;
this time, however, I cannot for the life of me see what is
behind the North Star&rsquo;s strategy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>&ldquo;This time,&rdquo; enlightened Acey Smith as he
bade Sir David good-bye, &ldquo;there is no strategy behind the
North Star&rsquo;s methods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acey Smith had barely left the president&rsquo;s office when a
stout, florid-faced man who had been waiting outside was ushered
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Sir David,&rdquo; he asked closing the
door, &ldquo;who is that extraordinary looking chap who just left
this office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; echoed Sir David Edwards-Jones rather
abstractedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a lumberman from the
Northwest.&nbsp; But, Dennison, he is also one of the most
remarkable, most inscrutable men in the whole Dominion of
Canada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which statement, vague as it was, contained as much
information as can usually be drawn from great bankers relative
to their customers.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the memorable Monday, October 16, one week
previous to the date at which the Kam City Pulp and Paper Mills
was under agreement with the government to be in full operation
manufacturing newsprint from the pulpwood boomed at Nannabijou
Limits or lose their cutting rights on the North Shore, Norman T.
Gildersleeve, president of the International Investment
Corporation, parent of the Kam City Company, was pacing the docks
at the limits and cursing the haste that had brought him out to
such a monotonous place a day before it was necessary.</p>
<p>The tugs which he had wired for from Duluth would not now
likely reach the limits until the following day, and, with all
the indications of rough weather that were apparent, they might
be later still.&nbsp; As a matter of fact&mdash;and Gildersleeve
was quite cognizant of <a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>that fact-the United States tugs
dare not touch a pole in the booms without the North Star&rsquo;s
permission until such time as Ontario government authority
intervened in the strike and approved of the use of the foreign
tugs as an emergency.&nbsp; But Gildersleeve considered himself a
master of the gambler&rsquo;s game of bluff.&nbsp; He had taken
every means of stimulating quick government action by means of
what he called &ldquo;hot grounders&rdquo; over the wires to the
premier and members of his cabinet in Toronto.&nbsp; The presence
of the fleet of American tugs, ready to pitch into the work of
transporting the poles, he calculated, would take the heart out
of the North Star Company.&nbsp; If it didn&rsquo;t&mdash;well,
he&rsquo;d have those tugs in readiness and he&rsquo;d sue the
North Star for the expense of bringing them over.</p>
<p>Whatever his reflections on the matter may have been on that
windy afternoon, his pacing suddenly came to an abrupt stop as he
caught, out of the corner of an eye, a dark object rising and
falling in the seas to the west.&nbsp; He peered fixedly as it
topped the next wave.&nbsp; Sure enough, it was a tug&mdash;but
it was not coming from the direction of Duluth.</p>
<p>Others came running down to the docks from divers directions
to gaze upon it with excited comment and conjecture.&nbsp; There
had not been a tug at the dock in days; not since the strike had
been called.</p>
<p>The great craft lifted valiantly against the flailing seas
until its plume, its stack and the dark hulk of its high forward
freeboard were plainly discernible.&nbsp; It whistled with what
seemed a jubilant note before it rounded into the gap of the
bay.</p>
<p>Gildersleeve started in pure amazement.&nbsp; On its
smokestack and in the centre of the sinister little blue-black
flag at its bow were the fiery-red, five-pointed stars that
designated the North Star fleet.</p>
<p><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>&ldquo;The strike is over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It went up a yell from the rabble on the docks.&nbsp; It was
answered with a shout from the men crowded on the bow of the
tug.&nbsp; Lumberjacks came pouring down from the camp and the
woods everywhere.&nbsp; There was the electric tension in the air
that obtains when man-packs sense that magic monster known as
News.</p>
<p>The crowd yelled and the tug&rsquo;s siren screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurr-r-rah for the Big Boss&mdash;he settled
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurr-r-rah for A-c-e-y Smith!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with the slogan went up a shout that shook the
woods.&nbsp; Bucksaw men, axe men and river men danced ridiculous
capers on the landing, jostling against each other and firing
their woollen caps high in air.&nbsp; It was an ovation such as
the demagogue, Slack, would have pawned his soul for&mdash;a
tribute from pent up spirits who, in their hearts of hearts, had
steadfastly believed when the worst came to the worst the Big
Boss would range himself on the side of his men.&nbsp; So much
for what they call personal magnetism.</p>
<p>The excitement died down somewhat when it was discovered that
the master of the Nannabijou camps was not on board.&nbsp; Had he
been, his first utterance no doubt would have been to pass the
honours for settling the strike to Hon. J. J. Slack, M.P.,
president of the North Star.</p>
<p>In the crowd leaving the tug&rsquo;s gang-plank Gildersleeve
glimpsed the short, corpulent figure of Artemus Duff, president
of the Kam City Pulp and Paper Mills, hurrying toward him.&nbsp;
Duff looked a bit mussed up from the trip over, but his round,
fat face was beaming.</p>
<h3><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>III</h3>
<p>Duff came forward and grasped the extended hand of
Gildersleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d run over and be
first to break the good news to you, Norman,&rdquo; he
puffed.&nbsp; &ldquo;The North Star gang had to come to their
oats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; observed Gildersleeve.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did you get any of the inside particulars,
Duff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a great deal.&nbsp; Slack made the announcement
to the tugmen that the company would meet their demands if they
would immediately return to their boats, and followed up with a
windy speech about his own efforts in their behalf.&nbsp; Guess
he received his orders from the big fellows that own him body and
soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They saw at last that their cake was dough,&rdquo;
commented Gildersleeve quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They could not have
held out much longer with their obvious trickery, for to-morrow
would have seen a fiat issued from the attorney-general&rsquo;s
department enjoining the North Star to make immediate settlement
of the strike and delivery of the poles.&nbsp; Oh, by the way,
Duff, did you think to wire Duluth cancelling the order for those
tugs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winch looked after that,&rdquo; informed the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&nbsp; I only hope the wire arrived before the
fleet set out.&nbsp; Gad, Duff, this was a master stroke of
ours,&rdquo; he spoke up emphatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
nailed the North Star&rsquo;s hide on the door inside out.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the beginning of the end for that iniquitous gang of
commercial cut-throats.&nbsp; Few people realise that the
culmination of this strike and the subsequent delivery of those
poles in the bay yonder writes the final chapter in dark history
that goes back to the beginning of things on this North
Shore.&nbsp; Once our mills at Kam City are in full operation,
with sufficient poles piled in the yards to keep them running six
months, we will have completed our covenant with the <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>government.&nbsp; Then watch me crush the North Star
and all its brazen subsidiaries!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gildersleeve paused in his pacing, proffered Duff a cigar and
lit one himself.&nbsp; He struck a Napoleonic attitude as he
swept his arm from south to north.&nbsp; &ldquo;All this North
Shore and its great potential wealth will soon again be under my
absolute domination,&rdquo; he predicted.&nbsp; &ldquo;With this
limits and the mills we will soon reduce the North Star&rsquo;s
power and prestige to a point where they will be glad to
surrender their lake fleet and equipment for their price as
junk.&nbsp; Their costly mill without machinery will help to sink
them and sink them fast.&nbsp; Nothing now can prevent our
complete victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duff rolled his unlighted cigar to the other side of his mouth
and chuckled effusively.&nbsp; &ldquo;They let their men go out
on strike just a few days too soon to catch us unawares,&rdquo;
he commented sagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their strike was a joke,&rdquo; sneered the president
of the International Investment Corporation.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
isn&rsquo;t a doubt now that they precipitated it with a view to
keeping every tug tied up until after our contract time for
having the mills running.&nbsp; The rest of their plot was
obvious: Once the government had nullified our coming rights on
these limits the North Star would come into re-possession of them
automatically.&nbsp; Then, with no raw product to draw from, we
would have been forced to sell our mill equipment to them at
their own price and our mill building would remain a vast white
elephant.&nbsp; We slipped a big one over on them when I put
through the deal that took away the machinery they had on
order.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why they were so keen on getting us
into a corner where we&rsquo;d have to let them have that same
machinery for a song.&nbsp; The North Star&rsquo;s middle name is
Revenge&mdash;and now they are going to get their bellyful of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>&ldquo;And this strike was the trump card they kept
hidden up their sleeve all summer,&rdquo; amended Duff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it was.&nbsp; But it was a mighty crude piece of
work, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if your oily friend, J.
J. Slack, loses his high-salaried job over the head of
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gildersleeve smiled grimly at the
prospect.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, the North Star evidently figured
on a long-drawn arbitration that would keep the strike hanging
fire until the time was up for delivery of the poles.&nbsp; They
were depending on Slack&rsquo;s prestige in politics being
powerful enough to prevent the provincial authorities from
forcing the issue.&nbsp; It was all a dismal failure, and
I&rsquo;d give much to see the Honourable Slack&rsquo;s face one
week from to-day when the Kam City Pulp and Paper Mills has its
official opening with members of the provincial cabinet present
as our official guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A perplexed shadow crossed Duff&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come to think of it, Slack didn&rsquo;t seem much upset
about it this afternoon,&rdquo; he suggested dubiously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In fact, he really acted as though the North Star had
gained a victory instead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slack&rsquo;s shallow brain doesn&rsquo;t fully
comprehend what it all means,&rdquo; waived Gildersleeve.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All he sees is the peanut politics&mdash;the prestige the
settlement of the strike will give him with the labour
vote.&nbsp; It is A. C. Smith, superintendent of these camps, and
the only member of the North Star executive in personal touch
with the outfit who finance the company, who will give him an
uncomfortable hour over the clumsy failure that&rsquo;s been made
of this piece of trickery.&nbsp; Smith&rsquo;s the slippery eel
of this concern I intend to land in the net once we&rsquo;ve
turned the North Star inside out.&nbsp; Once we&rsquo;ve got the
upper hand on the North Shore we will wield the political whip
with a commission of inquiry that will expose the North Star and
force them to a show-down.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; cautioned Duff looking
furtively behind him along the dock.&nbsp; &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t
tell around here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks, man, there&rsquo;s nothing to fear now;
I&rsquo;ve trimmed the claws of the North Star and they&rsquo;re
powerless even if they did know the hand we&rsquo;re about to
play.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gildersleeve lowered his voice: &ldquo;Right
now I&rsquo;ve got a man ferreting out their secret layout up in
the hills over there.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll tell you about that
after we go up to our shack.&nbsp; Come let&rsquo;s go over and
drop in on Inspector Little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reference to the settlement of the strike, to the surprise of
Gildersleeve and Duff, brought no elation into the face of the
police inspector.&nbsp; He merely continued to drum lightly on
the little table with a bit of amethyst rock he was using as a
paper weight.&nbsp; When he spoke his brows were puckered and he
kept his eyes centred on the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at
all satisfied with things,&rdquo; he complained.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
are out here to do our duty as we find it, but&rdquo;&mdash;and
he looked straight up into the eyes of Gildersleeve when he said
it&mdash;&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve a bit of a hunch that one or the
other of the two companies interested in the operations on these
limits is not playing square with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gildersleeve started.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just what do you mean,
Inspector?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that underhand work has been going on here since
the day we arrived and that it could not continue as it has
without the cognizance and backing of some one in
authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was at our instigation the police were brought out
here,&rdquo; insisted Gildersleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
scarcely likely we would ask you to guard the property we are
interested in and then set about deliberately double-crossing
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; Colourlessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you
were not the first to <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>ask for police protection.&nbsp; A
day before your request went in President Slack, of the North
Star Company, wired to Ottawa for Mounted Police protection at
the limits in case the strike materialised.&nbsp; Both companies
seemed intensely anxious to have our assistance; that&rsquo;s why
subsequent events rather puzzle me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What subsequent events in particular do you refer to,
Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to begin with there was the abduction of that
young lady living on Amethyst Island, the arrest of the fake camp
preacher, Nathan Stubbs, and the latter&rsquo;s jumping his bail
and disappearance.&nbsp; Now, some one with plenty of funds was
interested enough to forfeit one thousand dollars in order to get
Stubbs out of the clutches of the law.&nbsp; Mind you, I&rsquo;m
not saying it was either of the companies, but it was some party
vitally interested in what is going on out here, and one or the
other of the companies must know who.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duff shuffled and coughed and took a fresh tooth-hold on his
mangled dead cigar.&nbsp; Gildersleeve&rsquo;s face remained a
complete mask.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we haven&rsquo;t the
slightest idea,&rdquo; he observed with guileless
indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Some one</i> undoubtedly has,&rdquo; emphasised the
inspector.&nbsp; &ldquo;Furthermore, Stubbs must be quite
confident of his backing, else he wouldn&rsquo;t have the nerve
to return to the limits in broad daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gildersleeve almost jumped to his feet at that.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stubbs back here,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was seen less than an hour ago back in the hills by
some of our men out looking for the missing girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gildersleeve gave the inspector a glance that questioned his
sanity.&nbsp; It was Duff who spoke first.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did they
get him?&rdquo; he breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he disappeared in the bush as silently and
completely as a timber wolf.&rdquo;&nbsp; The inspector bent his
eyes <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>searchingly on Gildersleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was
playing the <i>other r&ocirc;le</i> this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other r&ocirc;le?&rdquo;&nbsp; The puzzled look on
Gildersleeve&rsquo;s face looked almost genuine to the police
officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that of Ogima Bush, the Medicine Man&mdash;the
same disguise he wore the morning he and his gang abducted Miss
Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all wrong&mdash;all pure piffle!&rdquo;
exploded Gildersleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo;&nbsp; Quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;because, damn it, man, that camp preacher
could never have played the role of the Medicine Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are one and the same man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The police inspector leaned forward, his eyes fixing those of
the financier like steely points of light.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you
can furnish proof of that statement, Mr. Gildersleeve,&rdquo; he
said at last, &ldquo;it would be very useful information for the
police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gildersleeve tightened up in a hurry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I have
nothing in the way of proof,&rdquo; he laughed easily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was merely a conviction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a vast difference,&rdquo; coldly observed
Inspector Little.&nbsp; &ldquo;A vast difference, Mr.
Gildersleeve.&nbsp; Nevertheless, your assertion provides the
germ of a new theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not add as the pulp mill men were leaving his tent that
that same new theory presented a worse tangle than the old
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stubbs the camp preacher had two enamelled patches
covered with talc powder under his eyes; Ogima Bush the Medicine
Man has two red gashes under his and this man Gildersleeve has
two tiny white scars in the same places.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those
observations kept recurring stubbornly in the inspector&rsquo;s
mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;if this part
of the North Shore isn&rsquo;t really under a hoo-doo as <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>the Indians
say it is&mdash;or, am <i>I</i> getting old and losing my
grip?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>Gildersleeve cautiously refrained from uttering what was on
his mind as he and Duff wended their way up to their quarters in
one of the smaller log shacks the former had rented during his
stay on the limits.</p>
<p>At the door, Gildersleeve paused to scan the lake and the
sky.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gad, it looks as though we are in for some bad
weather, Duff,&rdquo; he observed ominously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kin bank on that, Mister,&rdquo; offered a grizzled
lumberjack who stopped in passing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Win&rsquo;s been
a-blowin&rsquo; outen one spot all day&mdash;an&rsquo; when the
win&rsquo; don&rsquo;t follow the sun round on of Lake
Supe&rsquo; you kin look out fer high-jinks in the weather line
afore monin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

THE NIGHT OF THE TEMPEST</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun went down that evening on a
weird northern world.&nbsp; The wind, which had been pressing out
of the east all day, had dropped as at some elemental sunset
signal; but the great lake, lashed to fury, raced by windrow upon
windrow of long, curling &ldquo;shanty&rdquo; waves&mdash;the
terrible seas for which Superior in its wrath is peculiar.&nbsp;
Three &ldquo;mock suns&rdquo; stood in vertical alignment above
the declining orb of day, and the air was filled with a ghostly,
brassy light that tinted the wild hills, the forests and the
raging sea with its exotic saffron glow.</p>
<p>Nannabijou camp, aglare in the unreal light, its windows
flashing like blood-red jewels, stood out against the setting of
the sombre mountain ranges like a fantastic painting on the
canvas of some mad master.&nbsp; Above the southeastern horizon
hung a lowering blackness that presaged the hurricane to come,
while up from a hundred lonely bays along the rocky North Shore
the flailing waves sent up a thunderous, pounding roar.</p>
<p>From a plateau on Nannabijou Mountain above the beaver dam
lake on Solomon Creek, a figure that seemed the <i>genius
loci</i> of the fearsome night looked out upon these
things.&nbsp; His was a face of evil cunning, dusky almost to
blackness except where two red gashes stood out under the black
eyes&mdash;eyes which alone of all his sinister countenance
seemed alive and human.&nbsp; He wore no <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>covering
over his long straight black hair save a band of purple which
held in place a single eagle&rsquo;s feather at the back of his
head.&nbsp; Round his neck were hung many strings of glistening
wolves&rsquo; teeth.</p>
<p>Behind the Indian magician were ranged four headmen of the
Objibiways, as motionless as he, faces to the setting sun.</p>
<p>For moments they stood thus like statues of bronze, until a
lake gull, wheeling with a shrill scream inland, swooped close to
their heads.&nbsp; The Medicine Man turned, his gaze sweeping
Nannabijou Bay where the great booms of poles lay secure from the
assaults of the seas, took in the waterfront where the patrols of
police paced back and forward, and travelled to the blackness of
the coming storm.</p>
<p>Suddenly he raised his arms aloft and his lips gave utterance
to a strange, guttural incantation in which his companions
joined&mdash;a lugubrious sing-song in the Objibiway
tongue.&nbsp; It ended with a leaping, whirling sort of
dance.&nbsp; The witch doctor flung out a hand and from it there
flew a short cylindrical object that sang through the air like a
spent bullet and dropped with a soft &ldquo;plop&rdquo; far out
in the little lake.</p>
<p>In that cylinder was wrapped the Great Medicine of the
North&mdash;a charm which once used, the pagan tribes believe,
insures the success of any project no matter how beset with
difficulties and dangers.</p>
<p>At a low grunting command from the Medicine Man the Indians
turned and silently melted into the murk of the forest.&nbsp;
And, as they did so, there swept up from the woods a long-drawn,
frightful cry that carried far and wide above the surf roar from
below.</p>
<p>It was not the call of a timber wolf nor of other beast of the
wilderness.&nbsp; In its swiftly rising and falling <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>cadences it
was half laughter, half wail; a curious and awesome blending of
mockery and lamentations.</p>
<p>The rim of the setting sun flicked out in the gash of the
western cloud-banks and starless night dropped over the troubled
waters and the sighing woods.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The tempest broke over Nannabijou camp in shrieking fury
between seven and eight o&rsquo;clock out of a night of stygian
blackness.&nbsp; It came a great gust that screamed and skirled
overhead like legions of the damned on a terrestrial
rampage.&nbsp; Tents of the Mounties along the waterfront were
overthrown by the first blast and pressed flat as before the
smash of a giant&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Great trees were bent and
twisted until they turned over at the roots or broke at the base
like matches.</p>
<p>The rain was flung down with the wind in great drenching
splashes that beat through crevices of the windows and doors of
the camp buildings in hissing jets of spray.&nbsp; Every path and
roadway into the hills was transformed into a miniature torrent
racing down to the bay.</p>
<p>It was a night such as mocks the courage of the stouthearted
and sends the wonder-fright of children into the beings of
men.&nbsp; Every living thing in the camp scuttled to the most
convenient shelter, except the patrolling policemen, who
maintained their beats like fantastic wraiths of the storm the
while their searchlights played feebly into the murk and downpour
over the field of pulpwood booms in the bay.</p>
<p>Secure in a stout log cabin, Norman T. Gildersleeve and
Artemus Duff sat by a roaring fire in a sheet-iron Queen
heater.&nbsp; Duff, twisting his inevitable dead cigar from
corner to corner of his mouth, was obviously trying to conceal
the nervousness that was upon him.&nbsp; At each <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>succeeding
blast of the storm, which seemed to swoop down upon the cabin
like a demon bent on pressing it into the face of the earth, and
at the intermittent crash of falling timber, he would half start
from his chair, his fat cheeks blanching with terror and his
chubby knees quaking.&nbsp; Gildersleeve, whose early life had
inured him to the savage moods of the North, sat silent,
imperturbable, as though engrossed with some irrelevant
problem.</p>
<p>Suddenly the millionaire, like one awaking from a doze,
straightened in his chair and lit a fresh cigar.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gad, what a night, Duff,&rdquo; he mused.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a hell of a night.&rdquo;&nbsp; He glanced at his
watch.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder what in blazes has become of my man,
Lynch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s up there&mdash;in this&mdash;&rdquo; Duff
waved excitedly in the direction of the hills.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
he&rsquo;s up there&mdash;he&rsquo;s likely got his&mdash;by
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The confounded idiot!&rdquo; stormed Gildersleeve with
unfeeling heat.&nbsp; &ldquo;He ought to have had sense enough to
get out of the timber when he saw what was coming.&nbsp; Even a
child would know enough to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe when he saw it coming he decided to stay in some
safe place until it was over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not Lynch.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s scared plain stiff
of the bush at night.&nbsp; For a detective who&rsquo;s done
dirty, risky jobs all over the country he&rsquo;s the veriest
coward in the woods after nightfall.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d sneak into
a king&rsquo;s bed chamber and steal his private papers for a
ten-dollar bill, but he wouldn&rsquo;t go into the big timber
after sun-down for a million.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;what do you think&mdash;could have happened
to him?&rdquo;&nbsp; Duff was glad of any diversion, gruesome or
otherwise, that might take his thoughts off the raging of the
storm outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say, Duff.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gildersleeve
got up and paced the floor.&nbsp; &ldquo;He must have met with
some accident; <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>twisted an ankle in the windfalls, fallen over a cliff,
or else&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s hard to say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped in his tracks as a scraping thud resounded at the
cabin door.</p>
<p>Duff lurched to his feet as the door sprang open and the
bedraggled figure of a man thrust itself across the threshold
accompanied by a welter of flying rain that spattered across the
floor to the wall beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lynch!&rdquo; gasped Gildersleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me&mdash;least&mdash;what&rsquo;s
left&mdash;of me,&rdquo; asserted the newcomer between panting
gasps as he crowded the door shut.</p>
<p>He was a wiry-looking little man with a face like a rat; beady
eyes back of an insignificant nose, high upper lip and receding
chin.&nbsp; He immediately proceeded to divest himself of his
reefer and boots and stood up a-drip and steaming by the
sheet-iron stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Lynch,&rdquo; approved
Gildersleeve, &ldquo;let your clothes dry on you, and you
won&rsquo;t catch cold.&nbsp; Here, have a bolt of
Scotch.&rdquo;&nbsp; He poured out a stout bracer from a silver
pocket-flask into a metal cup and handed it to Lynch who downed
it neat at a gulp, his beady eyes glittering.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Gildersleeve, &ldquo;that&rsquo;ll make
a new man of you, Lynch.&nbsp; How is it you didn&rsquo;t strike
out for camp before it got dark and the storm came up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got lost,&rdquo; explained Lynch.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t notice it was getting late until it was near
sun-down.&nbsp; Tried to make a short cut through the bush to the
creek and lost my bearings in that rotten mess.&nbsp;
Couldn&rsquo;t see the sun or a blessed thing to guide me
out.&nbsp; Struggled in all kinds of circles through windfalls
breast-high and every time I&rsquo;d stop for breath I&rsquo;d
hear sneaking sounds all round me like things watching for me to
fall so they could jump me while I was down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then&mdash;I heard a horrible yell.&nbsp;
No, it wasn&rsquo;t <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>a yell either; it was like wailing
and laughing all mixed up.&nbsp; It made my blood run cold.&nbsp;
I can hear it yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;&nbsp; He shuddered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know which was the worst&mdash;floundering round in
the windfalls or coming down the trail in the hurricane with
deadfalls smashing down in the wind everywhere.&nbsp; I nearly
got mine with falling timber a dozen times, and every ten steps
or so I&rsquo;d go flying on my face in the muck.&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t go through it again for a hundred
thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re safe&mdash;it&rsquo;s all over
now,&rdquo; reminded Gildersleeve handing the detective a
cigar.&nbsp; &ldquo;The question is did you find out anything
worth while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found out something that ought to be worth a whole
lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; urged Gildersleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told
you there was a fifty-dollar bonus in it if you got a line on the
North Star&rsquo;s secret layout and their wireless plant up
there.&nbsp; That promise holds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s up in that devilish
place,&rdquo; remarked Lynch, &ldquo;but I did find out how they
get in and out of the Cup of Nannabijou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;&nbsp; Both Gildersleeve and Duff were
tense.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a creek-bed that dries up when you
touch a button.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companions stared blankly as though he had suddenly gone
crazy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;help me,&rdquo; insisted Lynch,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s just what it is.&nbsp; I found it out by pure
accident.&nbsp; Was poking around in a sort of tunnel that opens
out on the rapids of the creek when my foot caught in something,
and, in trying to stop myself from falling, I swung up a hand
against a piece of rock jutting from the wall.&nbsp; In my
business <a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>I keep my fingers as sensitive as a combination lock
expert.&nbsp; I guess if it hadn&rsquo;t been for that I
wouldn&rsquo;t have felt that little round hole in the
rock.&nbsp; I got out my pocket-flash and examined it.&nbsp; It
was only about the size of a nail, drilled into the rock about an
inch and a half.&nbsp; I could see then that that knob of rock
had been cleverly cemented into a hole in the wall.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A&rsquo;ha,&rsquo; thinks I, &lsquo;this is a spring that
opens some secret entrance through the rock.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
wasn&rsquo;t at all expecting what it really turned out to
be.&nbsp; So I gets a match, inserts it in the hole and presses
down on it just to see what would happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a flash like lightning, and a queer, soft
sound like a gong came from up above somewhere.&nbsp; Then in a
minute it seemed to me the creek rapids just down the tunnel got
awful quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went down to investigate, and sure enough there was
no water running down, and if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the wet at
the bottom and sides of the channel I wouldn&rsquo;t have
believed there ever had been.&nbsp; I slipped back and pressed
the match against the concealed button again.&nbsp; The bell rang
and almost right away the water came roaring down like it was
before.&nbsp; Now I think that was pretty good scouting for one
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t try going up the creek bottom to see
where it led to,&rdquo; Gildersleeve pressed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much.&nbsp; I up and beat it.&nbsp; Something
mighty queer about it all that sort of got my goat, and besides I
was scared that bell ringing would bring some one round that
might use me rough.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know it had got so late
until I was out in the daylight again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; mused Gildersleeve,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s how they get up into the Cup.&nbsp; Well,
to-morrow we&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He strode over and
stood staring at the circular draft-vent of the little stove.</p>
<p>What he might have said was left unfinished for there <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>came a
great crash above the howlings of the storm that made the earth
shudder.&nbsp; It was followed by a continuous pounding thunder
that grew louder and louder as though the tops had slid from the
mountains and were crashing down to the lake.&nbsp; Nearer and
more formidable it grew, setting the building a-quiver at each
succeeding smash until it seemed to sweep into and through the
very heart of the camp.</p>
<p>The three men stood speechless and aghast, staring into each
other&rsquo;s terror-smitten countenances.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>Gildersleeve was the first to move.&nbsp; With an inarticulate
cry he flung open the door and leaped into the night.</p>
<p>Outside all was pandemonium.&nbsp; With the advent of the new
terror the storm had subsided considerably, though rain was still
pouring down.&nbsp; Men awakened from their sleep were rushing
everywhere through the wet and darkness.&nbsp; There were
hysterical shouts and coarse, ugly curses.&nbsp; In another
moment scores of lanterns gleamed blearily in the murk and the
search-lights of the police sent shafts of light playing up from
the waterfront.</p>
<p>Twenty-five feet from the river Gildersleeve found the
Mounties holding back the crowd with hoarse commands, their
carbines held crosswise before them.</p>
<p>Conjecture ran rife.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cloud-burst in the
hills,&rdquo; some one cried.&nbsp; And another: &ldquo;Look,
look, the Nannabijou River&rsquo;s roarin&rsquo; full to the top
of the banks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bridge is going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came the wail of great timbers as they were twisted and
torn from their places.&nbsp; As Gildersleeve&rsquo;s eyes became
more adjusted to the dim, uncertain light, he saw that the
torrent rode almost to the brim of the high banks of the
Nannabijou, fully thirty feet above the <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>stream&rsquo;s normal level.&nbsp; In mad succession on
its crest swirled logs, stumps, whole trees and other debris from
the hills.</p>
<p>It was a terrifying, majestic sight, this great river moving
out like an all-conquering, irresistible host, and carrying
captive the things that stood in the way of its might as it swept
from the confining hills to the freedom of the lake.</p>
<p>From beyond the mouth of the river, above the din of the storm
and the freshet in the hills came a sibilant hissing sound like
that when waves break over jagged reefs, only this was
intensified a hundred-fold.</p>
<p>Shafts of light from the search-lights were flung over the
bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The booms are going out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gildersleeve stood fascinated, dumb before the
inevitable.&nbsp; The gorged river flinging itself out into the
bay swept over the field of pulpwood an ever-widening tidal wave;
then the poles rose through the boiling flood, heaving flat for
one instant and the next rolled forward in great jams that again
held until the invading torrent, gathering head, swept them
before it in tossing, grinding masses.</p>
<p>The unequal struggle lasted but a few brief seconds.&nbsp;
Then when the connecting links of the boom timbers beyond gave
way the whole field of pulpwood sprang forward with a mighty,
grinding roar and crowded out of the bay into the raging lake
beyond where wind and wave carried it off in howling triumph.</p>
<p>In less time than it takes to tell the magnificent field,
comprising thousands of cords of wood ready for grinding, had
vanished all but an insignificant remnant the backwash had flung
up on the shores of the bay.</p>
<p>The torrent in the river was gradually subsiding now, but
still the crowd hung about in the drenching rain.</p>
<p><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>&ldquo;What do you think caused it!&rdquo; some one who
had just come up asked of a little knot near Gildersleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloud-burst in the hills most likely,&rdquo; vouchsafed
one of the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloud-burst nothing,&rdquo; derided another.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I could tell you just what happened: The beaver-dam in
Solomon Creek has busted and let that lake of water behind it
loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, it will make more work for the workers,&rdquo;
piped a loose-tongued disciple of Lenin.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
be kept busy salvagin&rsquo; them poles up along the shore till
the freeze-up comes and all next spring.&nbsp; The North Star
won&rsquo;t let all that good timber go to waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salvage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word rang in the brain of Norman T. Gildersleeve like a
clang of doom.&nbsp; It meant&mdash;it meant that those poles
could now never be recovered in time to start the Kam City Mills
on the date set by the government.</p>
<p>The crowd was thinning out, but Gildersleeve, soaked to the
skin, stood as one in a daze till a police officer came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Costly night&rsquo;s damage for the North Star Company,
sir,&rdquo; he remarked gravely.</p>
<p>Norman T. Gildersleeve made a strange noise in his throat but
no more coherent answer as he stood staring into the blackness
over the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then they say that timber can be salvaged in due
time,&rdquo; suggested the friendly officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salvaged&mdash;in due time,&rdquo; echoed the financier
vacantly.&nbsp; Then to the policeman&rsquo;s amazement he let
loose a torrent of bitter curses and flung his arms about like a
madman.</p>
<h3><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>V</h3>
<p>Back at the cabin Duff and Lynch ceased their chatter about
the disaster at sight of Gildersleeve&rsquo;s grim, ghastly
face.&nbsp; In silence he made preparations to retire.</p>
<p>Just before he blew out the light, Lynch approached
Gildersleeve&rsquo;s bunk.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will we be going up into
the hills to look over that secret passageway in the
morning?&rdquo; he asked tactlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go where you damned well please&mdash;to hell
and back, if you like,&rdquo; came the snarling retort.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Any place will suit me to-morrow&mdash;any place outside
this cursed country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But while Gildersleeve cursed the north country, as others who
have failed to conquer its moods and its tremendous difficulties
have cursed it, he sensed in this last disaster the hand of an
agency that was not the elements&mdash;an inscrutable, sinister
agency that had thwarted, blocked and bankrupted his projects on
the North Shore for two decades&mdash;an agency that, however
exotic the idea might seem, had in its destructive designs the
coordination of the tempest.</p>
<p>As he tossed sleepless between the grey blankets his thoughts
kept converging on something Lynch had given utterance to in the
story of his flight down Nannabijou Mountain&mdash;something that
faintly but insistently brought up black memories out of his
early youth.&nbsp; He tried to think of other things, to laugh it
away as a foolish bit of imagination.&nbsp; It was no
use&mdash;the face of a youth rose before his tortured eyes, a
face handsome and boyish, but very dark of skin.&nbsp; It was the
eyes in that face&mdash;those terrible, great black eyes where he
saw mirrored in turn entreaty, despair&mdash;then black, black
hate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alexander!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gildersleeve breathed it in wretched entreaty.&nbsp; His <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>hands
involuntarily went upwards as he felt a stinging smash first
under the right eye, next under the left.&nbsp; The points where
the two tiny scars were stung like fire.</p>
<p>Then he heard. . . .&nbsp; Great God, he heard out in the
night somewhere a cry that made his soul quake.</p>
<p>Gildersleeve sprang from his bunk.&nbsp; With hands that
trembled he lit the lamp and shook Lynch into wakefulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lynch,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;that cry you heard up
in the hills when you were coming down&mdash;just what was it
like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective sat up blinking.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
likely ever to forget it, Mr. Gildersleeve,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a howl that was half laughter, half
wail&mdash;like the cry of a loon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gildersleeve started back a-tremble.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And&mdash;and did you see anything, Lynch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;help me the only living thing I saw I
didn&rsquo;t want to tell you of before&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t
believe it.&nbsp; As heaven is my judge, the thing that gave that
terrible cry <i>was in the shape of a man</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I wanted to know, Lynch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gildersleeve stumbled back to his bunk leaving the light
burning.&nbsp; Between teeth that chattered he mumbled to
himself:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cry of a loon&mdash;from a man.&nbsp; At
last&mdash;at last, I understand.&rdquo;</p>

258</span>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
J.C.X.!</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Josephine Stone</span> was seated in the
library of the chateau up in the Cup of Nannabijou after the
zenith of the storm had passed that night.&nbsp; Earlier in the
evening she and Mrs. Johnson with some apprehension had watched
the storm coming up, but it broke with much less violence there
than it did down on the waterfront, the high cliffs of the Cup
effectually diverting the fury of the tempest, whose roar they
could hear in the upper air while the rain came down in
torrents.&nbsp; Mrs. Johnson, who was invariably up before the
sun, retired early, but Miss Stone did not feel that she could
compose herself for sleep.&nbsp; Since childhood high winds had
always made her restless and nervous.</p>
<p>She had been sitting in her room reading a book she had
brought up from the library.&nbsp; An hour had passed, when,
above the lash of the driving rain, she was certain she heard the
rumble of voices outside; then the opening and closing of a door
in the building adjacent where the wireless station was
located.&nbsp; Some of the Indians who looked after the place
slept there, but she was sure they could not be up and about
unless something unusual had happened.&nbsp; They invariably went
to their slumbers and were not seen or heard from after
sundown.</p>
<p>Josephine Stone got up and going to the window cautiously
lifted a corner of the drawn blind.&nbsp; A light shone in the
wireless building, but she could see nothing of <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>what was
going on inside.&nbsp; The nervousness that was upon her
precluded sleep and it was becoming too chilly to sit up in her
room.&nbsp; She thought of going down to the library and building
a wood fire in the huge fireplace.&nbsp; That would possibly
cheer her up, she felt.</p>
<p>But when the fire was leaping high and crackling loudly she
still felt the need of something to occupy her mind.&nbsp; There
was an eerie, insistent personality to the library.&nbsp; Its
high, small-paned French windows were heavily-curtained, and its
furniture, of a substantial design several decades old, was
upholstered in the same sombre brown tone that characterised the
curtains and the great deep-piled rug that occupied the entire
floor space.&nbsp; Curtained wall-shelves and ancient,
glass-doored cases were crowded with leather-bound volumes of a
heterogeneous variety as well as departmental government books in
blue paper covers.&nbsp; There were several tiers of the
classics, dog-eared and much thumb-worn, but the majority of the
books were devoted to science, psychology, mineralogy and
forestry.&nbsp; None of the books contained a name to designate
to whom they belonged, though many of the older ones had
fly-leaves torn from them that bespoke some one&rsquo;s
precaution against identification.</p>
<p>The girl, tiring of rummaging through the books, turned her
attention to the square, black mahogany piano across one corner
of the room, wondering vaguely what might be the history of this
strange place, what story these walls might tell if they could
speak.&nbsp; It was a quaint old instrument with a wonderfully
mellow tone.&nbsp; Some cultured person must have at some time
occupied this chateau, some one of a distinctly scientific turn,
she reflected.&nbsp; Who were they and what had become of
them?&nbsp; She shivered involuntarily.&nbsp; Was it fancy, or
did she sense a silent, unseen presence in this room?</p>
<p>She ran her lithe fingers over the keys and struck up <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>a popular
air from memory.&nbsp; The music seemed to dissipate her
oppression and lift the heavy melancholy of her surroundings.</p>
<p>The girl played on and on, until wearying of memory
selections, she thought to look over a sheaf of music on the back
of the instrument.&nbsp; During the pause she was sure she heard
a light tapping at the door off the hall to her left.</p>
<p>She listened, at first quite startled; but when the tapping
was repeated, something human and deferential in the summons
reassured her.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Josephine Stone switched on the hall light, opened the door
leading to the porch and drew back with a startled
exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smith!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was no longer fright that was upon her.&nbsp; Something
was so daringly appropriate in his appearance, so grotesque on
the part of the picturesque master of Nannabijou camps that she
had to smile in spite of herself.&nbsp; She had never seen him
thus garbed before; quite debonaire and at ease in a dark,
tailored suit and the habiliments of a man of fashion&mdash;a
handsome, compelling type, faultlessly groomed from his
close-cropped, crisp black hair and clean-shaven face to the tips
of his fine black shoes.&nbsp; Even his flicker of a smile, which
usually had something grim and sinister in it, now radiated
goodwill in its becoming elegance.&nbsp; Frank admiration shone
in the lustre of his great black eyes.</p>
<p>He was bowing graciously, hat in hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard
you playing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I could not resist the
temptation of looking in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood to one side holding the door for him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then <a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>you invited yourself over; I suppose I must let you
come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew it was not the proper thing at this hour, but then
Josephine Stone was an unusual girl who had a ready confidence in
herself.&nbsp; What she meant to do was to demand of him why she
was being held a prisoner here&mdash;why she had been forcibly
carried off from Amethyst Island by his band of Indians.</p>
<p>He accompanied her to the library.&nbsp; There she turned upon
him, her whole demeanour intensely frigid.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
then,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;I want you to tell me what all
this means!&nbsp; Why have I been brought to this place against
my will by your gang of cut-throats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had meant to be acid, but there was that in his bantering
smile that disarmed her, made her impotent to find the words that
would humiliate him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not to-night,&rdquo; he declined.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It would take too long.&nbsp; To-morrow I will come to
explain everything to you; then you may condemn me, excoriate me
at your will.&nbsp; For these few rare moments to-night let
us&mdash;just be friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You choose rather unconventional hours for your
friendly calls, Mr. Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed outright at the scornful thrust, a ringing, boyish
laugh, totally unlike the sterner man she had known.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; he conceded, &ldquo;but
beggars can&rsquo;t be choosers, you know.&nbsp; I came in the
first place because of the storm.&nbsp; I thought you might be
nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you came to entertain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her glance
travelled unconsciously to his clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad if I add to the gaiety of
nations,&rdquo; he offered whimsically, &ldquo;but my other
clothing got soaked in the downpour coming here and these city
decorations were the only things I had by that were dry.&nbsp;
Catering to a <a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>whim over the success of certain ventures, I put them
on as a sort of celebration.&nbsp; Then I saw your light over
here and heard you playing, and I thought I&rsquo;d step over and
see if everything was all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All dressed up and you simply had to have some place to
go,&rdquo; flashed Josephine Stone, but in a better nature that
he made contagious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely that was it.&nbsp; Even in the bush people are
vain once in awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But since you came to entertain and not to explain, Mr.
Smith, wouldn&rsquo;t it have been really thoughtful to have
brought along your Indian friend, Ogima Bush?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might have proved quite difficult.&nbsp; Did you
find Ogima entertaining?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a Satanic way, yes.&nbsp; He has at least one
virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consistency.&nbsp; He has no fickle moods; he is always
just what he is&mdash;a savage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That subtle thrust, she saw, went under the skin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t know Ogima,&rdquo; he
observed gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is faithful to his friends and
he has the rare quality of being sincere.&nbsp; Yes, and he is
consistent.&nbsp; With the exception of those artificial red
gashes under his eyes, Ogima is one hundred per cent. what he
appears to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But come,&rdquo; he urged with an apparent desire to
change the subject, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you going to play for
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; A spirit of contrariness prompted
her to tantalise him, to make this audacious, dandified czar of
the big timber feel ill at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had taken it for granted <i>I</i> was to be
entertained,&rdquo; she insisted, smiling in spite of herself at
the conceit of the tiny, scintillating white diamond in his
tie.</p>
<p>But even in his present playful mood Acey Smith had his nimble
wits with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-morrow is your <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>birthday,&rdquo; he observed irrelevantly, his flashing
black orbs resting on hers momentarily.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will be
twenty-one and have reached a woman&rsquo;s estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was she who was caught perplexed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How&mdash;how did you know that?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proverbial little bird must have been tattling to
me.&nbsp; At any rate, it just now struck me that this being the
eve of so important an anniversary your slightest whim should be
gratified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning what?&rdquo;&nbsp; She was trying hard to feign
indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I must entertain you as you have
insisted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She watched him stride across the room.&nbsp; She thought at
first he was going to the piano; instead he leant over the back
of the instrument and brought up a black case from which he
extracted a violin and bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what shall it be?&rdquo; he asked with the bow
poised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, something light and lively&mdash;a popular
air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shade of a frown flickered at his brows.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
I know is rather ancient; but it shall be as you command, Milady
Caprice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He struck up a bit from an old comic opera.&nbsp; Josephine
Stone sank to a seat.&nbsp; There she lost sense of the bizarre
nature of this scene.&nbsp; This man was no mean amateur airing a
mechanical talent.&nbsp; He executed no flourishes; his form
scarcely swayed as the bow rode the responding strings like a
thing possessed of life.</p>
<p>The girl sat enraptured till he had concluded two rollicking
melodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you wonderful man!&rdquo;&nbsp; It came from her
spontaneously as she clapped her little hands in sheer
delight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where did you learn to play so
exquisitely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old man who once lived here taught me the
rudiments.&nbsp; The rest I picked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it must have taken years of practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>&ldquo;It has been my one genuine diversion.&nbsp; I
often come here when the mood seizes me and play for a solid
evening&mdash;but never before to a living audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was replacing bow and instrument in the case.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; she entreated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just one more selection anyway, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without show of diffidence he prepared to comply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;More light stuff?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Something serious&mdash;your own choice this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was &ldquo;Unrequited Love,&rdquo; from the opera
Rigoletto, that he played, a rendition Josephine Stone was
destined never to quite forget.</p>
<p>From the first tragic note the man before her seemed
metamorphosed&mdash;seemed one with his exquisite violin; and, as
the wailing, beseeching soul-cry of the rejected lover rose and
fell, cried out in the volume of those notes the depths of its
anguish, and tremulously swooned its everlasting despair, the
player ceased for her to be Acey Smith, the piratical, sinister
timber boss.&nbsp; He swayed before her fascinated gaze a
beautiful disembodied spirit of melancholy calling to the
subtlest deeps of her being.&nbsp; Once again, as on that
memorable morning at the beach, the soul that looked out at her
from those great, dark eyes was the soul of an untarnished
boy&mdash;a soul brilliant and aspiring, no longer shackled to
the clay of iniquity.</p>
<p>Unconscious she was that he drew nearer and nearer, a new
light in his black, masterful eyes that was devouring,
mesmeric.&nbsp; Unconscious she was in the spell of it that she
had fluttered back on the divan&mdash;inert, a helpless thing,
hopelessly enmeshed in the web of his romantic magnetism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josephine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bow and violin dropped heedlessly to the floor.&nbsp; He drew
her hungrily to his arms, swept her from the divan, <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>from her
feet and up to him till her panting form was folded to his
own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josephine, Josephine, Josephine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was low and hoarse with passion, his face close to
hers.</p>
<p>Then: &ldquo;Great God, what a cad I am!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>The spell upon her was broken.&nbsp; But before she could cry
out he had released her, his form a-tremble and his hands cupping
piteously to his mouth in that weird gesture she had once before
witnessed.</p>
<p>She staggered back, white to the lips, her hands clenched at
her breast.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her accusing tones fell on him like blows as he stood with
bowed head.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he acknowledged
contritely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had forgotten a sacred trust&mdash;a
trust I was unworthy of.&nbsp; But&mdash;but it shall not happen
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was steadying her trembling limbs.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&mdash;I
shall always be afraid of you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do not say that,&rdquo; he implored.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You will not have much longer to endure my
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At heart she was sorry for him already.&nbsp; Perhaps it was
this physical trouble which seized him like the ague in moments
of acute emotion that drew her woman&rsquo;s sympathy; perhaps
she conceded it was the situation, the tenseness brought about by
acute artistic emotion that was largely to blame&mdash;though he
had the bigness to offer no such excuses.</p>
<p>At any rate, she could not find it in her heart to condemn
this proud, handsome man, who, though he held her here utterly in
his power, was abjectly humbled before the flash of her
scorn.</p>
<p><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>Still
she said: &ldquo;There is only one explanation that might restore
my confidence, and that is a genuine one as to why you had me
brought here, why you insist on detaining me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brightened.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-morrow you shall have that
explanation in full as I have promised you&mdash;after you have
met J.C.X.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;J.C.X.?&rdquo;&nbsp; She smiled incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Circumstances made it necessary for you to
move from Amethyst Island until such time as I was at liberty to
carry out that promise.&nbsp; You demurred about leaving, while I
feared disastrous intervention during my enforced absence in the
east; that is why you were brought here in haste without your
consent&mdash;that and my inherent weakness for the
dramatic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;at last a candid confession!&nbsp; Then let us
get down to earth as quickly as possible.&nbsp; I am weary of
playing Alice in Wonderland awaiting the production of your
fabled monster.&nbsp; Mr. Smith, let me reciprocate in your
candour.&nbsp; I have observed sufficient since I came to the
Nannabijou Limits to convince me that there is only one head to
the North Star Company, one man who rules and dictates
here&mdash;and that man is yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, but I do so under a trusteeship for
J.C.X.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem at least to have convinced yourself of his
existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it all a fraud&mdash;a hoax?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so.&nbsp; Others you may have
succeeded in deluding as to the existence of this imaginary
creature behind whose personality you carry on your affairs, but
I will not believe until I see.&nbsp; Furthermore, I
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> believe you can produce him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you shall see J.C.X.&mdash;to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>IV</h3>
<p>He took her arm and led her across the room to a point near
the entrance to the hall.&nbsp; There he gently swung her so that
she faced the wall and he stood directly behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he indicated.&nbsp; &ldquo;There you may
see the J.C.X. for whom till to-night I have anonymously guided
the affairs of the North Star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josephine Stone drew back with a startled cry.&nbsp; She was
staring into a wall mirror <i>at the reflection of
herself</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she heard his voice as from afar
off.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-morrow, she who until now has been known as
J.C.X., takes living control of the affairs of the North
Star.&nbsp; To-morrow, on her twenty-first birthday, she must, as
the lawful heir to this property, bear with me while I give an
account of my stewardship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She heard, as in a dream, the hall door beyond closing
softly.&nbsp; When she turned Acey Smith was gone.&nbsp; But out
in the night somewhere there arose a tortured cry&mdash;a
smothered cry that died out in the encompassing sweep of the
storm.</p>
<p>Mad, she conjectured. . . .&nbsp; Yes, Acey Smith was a
madman.&nbsp; Yet, her intuition told her, his was the madness of
abnormal genius with a fixed purpose&mdash;always
misunderstood&mdash;a desperate visionary with the imagination
and power of will to make his mad dreams come true.</p>
<p>She&mdash;she &ldquo;the lawful heir to this
property!&rdquo;&nbsp; Her grandfather had been previously
referred to by Acey Smith.&nbsp; Could it be&mdash;?</p>
<p>But in her perplexed, unnerved state, Josephine Stone did the
womanly thing.&nbsp; She went to her room and had a hearty
cry.</p>

268</span>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
IN WHICH A FOOL EXPERIMENTS</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Setting</span> out on his a&euml;rial trip
over the Cup of Nannabijou did not prove so simple a matter as
Hammond had at first conceived it would be.&nbsp; In the first
place, he had to get permission from the department at Ottawa
before the authorities at the Kam City armouries would even allow
him to try out the plane.&nbsp; Though he despatched Inspector
Little&rsquo;s wire immediately after his arrival, it was Monday
afternoon before a reply was forthcoming.</p>
<p>The next delay was in getting the machine in shape for the
trip.&nbsp; For want of expert attention, the motors and
accessories were wofully out of tune, and before he felt
satisfied that they were in anything like efficient shape it was
too late to make the trip Monday.&nbsp; On the short trial
flights he made the engine still showed a disposition to sulk,
but by careful handling he managed to keep it alive while in the
air.</p>
<p>He determined to fly over the Nannabijou Limits as early as
possible Monday morning.&nbsp; Monday night the storm came up,
one of the worst experienced in Kam City in years, and the shed
out on the exhibition grounds in which he had temporarily housed
the machine, was unroofed by the gale and minor damages done to
the wings of the plane that it took a couple of hours to
repair.</p>
<p>The morning, however, broke crisp and clear, an ideal day for
flying and making observations.&nbsp; From Kam <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>City to the
Nannabijou Limits was a little better than twenty miles, and
Hammond figured he could make it in about twenty-five to thirty
minutes at the outside.</p>
<p>But again he had trouble in making a start.&nbsp; Three times
he went up and had to come down again to make fresh
adjustments.&nbsp; It was ten o&rsquo;clock before he was
definitely on his way across the arm of the lake with the
craterlike top of Nannabijou Mountain as his objective.</p>
<p>Though the wind had dropped, the lake was still creased with
angry waves.&nbsp; He crossed Superior&rsquo;s upper arm without
mishap.&nbsp; As he neared the limits, his first unusual
discovery was the immense amount of pulpwood thrown up along the
North Shore and on the islands that dotted it as far as the eye
could see.&nbsp; There was only one place all those poles could
come from, the airman conjectured as his machine roared onward
through the bright, sunlit upper air.</p>
<p>His hunch was confirmed when he came opposite the limits and
secured a full view of Nannabijou Bay, empty of almost every
pulp-pole.</p>
<p>He dropped down for a closer look.&nbsp; The Mounties still
patrolled the waterfront, but the camp was a scene of animated
chaos.&nbsp; Gangs of men were at work repairing the roadways
riven deep by the torrents of the night before while others were
engaged in removing the fallen timber that blocked every
thoroughfare.&nbsp; He noted that the bridge over the Nannabijou
River was gone and the hills were made more desolate by fresh
fields of tangled windfalls.</p>
<p>As he swooped, Hammond glimpsed Inspector Little signalling to
him to proceed direct to the Cup and return.&nbsp; The young
airman picked out a likely looking landing place back of the
limits, then shot his machine upward.&nbsp; He followed the
course of the Nannabijou to <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>the point where Solomon Creek made
its confluence, when he swerved and followed the creek.</p>
<p>Below him now he could discern what had caused the flood that
had swept down in the night and carried out the immense field of
pulpwood boomed in the bay.&nbsp; The huge beaver-dam on the
creek was gone, and where the lake had been, behind the dam,
there remained only a slimy area of silt and mud.&nbsp; Thus it
was brought home to him at a glance that the war between the
rival lumber companies for the operating rights on the limits had
been ended by the elements in favour of the North Star. . .&nbsp;
The elements alone?&nbsp; He wondered. . . .&nbsp; Likely here
was another mystery in the history of the North Star that would
remain unsolved.&nbsp; Nobody had seemingly thought of the
possibilities in case that lake of water behind the beaver-dam
were set free.</p>
<p>Significant as all these things were, Hammond&rsquo;s main
interest was soon centred on the Cup of Nannabijou and its
environs.&nbsp; As he glided over the draw in the cliffs along
the creek trail to where it seemingly ended in the tunnel opening
out over the rapids in the gorge he got a true perspective of the
water-gate guarding the only entrance from the land side through
the cliffs of the Cup.&nbsp; From his lofty point of observation
he could note how the creek in the first place had cut a big
oval-shaped &ldquo;O&rdquo; in the rock, leaving a high pinnacle
in the centre.</p>
<p>But it was the man-made device for diverting the flow of water
that most excited his curiosity.&nbsp; At the upper end, where
the stream originally forked around the island of rock, was a
contrivance like the walking-beam of an old-style
steamship.&nbsp; From the ends of this beam, which sat in a steel
pillar between the channels, connecting-rods reached down to
sliding dams operating in slots cut in the sides of the
channels.&nbsp; At the present moment, the dam on the western
side was down, and the one on the <a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>eastern side up, thus forcing the
whole volume of water from the overflow of the lake in the Cup
down the latter channel, whose bed, when the dam on that side was
closed forcing the water around the other way, formed a dry
continuation of the creek trail to an upper tunnel leading
through the cliffs and into the Cup of Nannabijou.</p>
<p>Chains extending from concealed mechanism below the
walking-beam proved the dams to be operated by power.&nbsp; A
tiny building, cleverly cached in a natural opening in the rocks
at the west side, and from which copper wire was strung into the
Cup, housed the hydro-electric plant where the current was
generated.&nbsp; Hammond was scientific enough to conceive that
the water-gate and the gong-signal near it were animated by a
concealed magnet system at the simple pressing of an electric
button somewhere.</p>
<p>As he swept into the Cup, Hammond&rsquo;s discovery of the
beautiful little mountain lake and the buildings above it, set
off by their well-kept parklike surroundings, was even more of a
revelation.&nbsp; From the plane it proved a wonderful
picture&mdash;so wonderful that Hammond forgot he was in an area
of danger until it recurred to him that here some place Josephine
Stone was held captive.</p>
<p>But when he circled over the chateau and the wireless plant,
he could discover no signs of life.&nbsp; He was certain if there
were people about their attention would have long since been
attracted by the roar of his engine.&nbsp; He decided to land and
make an investigation in spite of the caution of Inspector Little
that he should return to the camps after making observations from
the air.</p>
<p>He slid down at a point in front of the bungalow.</p>
<h3><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>II</h3>
<p>The silence after quitting his machine seemed oppressive, and
the place utterly deserted.&nbsp; He walked up on the verandah
and rapped thrice on the chateau door.&nbsp; Receiving no answer,
he tried the door.&nbsp; It was not locked, so he opened it and
boldly entered.&nbsp; He was now determined to explore the
building from top to bottom.&nbsp; The quaint, unusual
appointments of the chateau at another time would have deeply
interested him, but he felt he must work fast and be on the alert
for surprise.</p>
<p>The rooms all bore the appearance of recent occupancy, but
there were evidences that the house had been set in order before
the departure of its people.</p>
<p>The sleeping chambers he examined last.&nbsp; All of these
rooms had been swept, dusted and the beds made; but in one of
them he picked up a fancy celluloid hair-comb.&nbsp; There was
only one person on Nannabijou Limits to whom that could belong,
and that was Josephine Stone.</p>
<p>The conviction brought home to Hammond from every quarter was
that he had arrived too late.&nbsp; Josephine Stone&rsquo;s
captors must have carried her off to some other fastness.&nbsp;
He thought of the building adjacent, but on going there he found
the doors and windows securely locked.&nbsp; The blinds, however,
were up, and he could get a clear view of all the rooms and the
wireless plant inside.&nbsp; There was nothing else there beyond
a number of empty bunks, a table and a few chairs.</p>
<p>It struck him that there was possibly another retreat hidden
away in some other part of the Cup&mdash;perhaps up in the
woods.&nbsp; He returned to the plane intending to make a
thorough search of the area in the Cup from the air.&nbsp; But
his engine was in a decidedly balky mood.&nbsp; He had a feeling
it would fail him altogether, and, on an impulse of better
judgment, he swung up and over the cliffs.</p>
<p><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>He
had barely reached the confluence of Solomon Creek with
Nannabijou River when the motor went dead.</p>
<p>Fortunately, by skillful manipulation of the planes, he was
enabled to glide safely down over the timbered sides of the
mountain to the cleared area just above Nannabijou camps.</p>
<p>His plane was soon surrounded by wondering groups of camp
workers from among whom there strode a member of the mounted
force.&nbsp; He leaned close as Hammond was getting out of the
machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inspector Little would like you to go down to his
quarters at once, Mr. Hammond,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will see that your machine is taken care of.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>The inspector&rsquo;s genial smile and hearty handshake did
much to revive Hammond&rsquo;s drooping spirits over his
nonsuccess in finding trace of Miss Stone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mighty
glad to see you back safe and sound, old man,&rdquo; he
offered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Find any clues up there as to the
whereabouts of the young lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Briefly Hammond gave a verbal report of his discoveries,
adding that he was convinced Josephine was still held prisoner
somewhere up in the Cup.</p>
<p>The inspector sat for a few moments in a brown study.&nbsp;
&ldquo;H&rsquo;mph, that&rsquo;s interesting at any rate,&rdquo;
he finally spoke up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your findings seem to bear out
what I have already learned from other quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to return and finish the investigation
as soon as I can get the old bus in working order,&rdquo;
suggested Hammond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I couldn&rsquo;t approve of that,&rdquo; decided
the inspector.&nbsp; &ldquo;With that balky machine it would be
too risky, and besides, it might give warning to the gang
we&rsquo;re after if <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>they did not succeed in capturing
you or doing you actual bodily harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what do you propose to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go up on foot with a half dozen picked members of
our force just as soon as you&rsquo;ve had a bite to eat and
changed your flying togs.&nbsp; A private detective of
Gildersleeve&rsquo;s&mdash;Lynch his name is&mdash;has discovered
how that water-gate up there is operated, and we&rsquo;re taking
him along to show us how to get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Gildersleeve here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was, but he left for town on the early tug this
morning, though I have a hunch I should have put him in custody
until this whole thing is cleared up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still suspect him of underhand work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now I hardly know what to suspect.&nbsp; There
seems to be some unholy mystery here that&rsquo;s mighty
difficult to get to the bottom of.&nbsp; Gildersleeve may be
innocent of having anything to do with the abduction of Miss
Stone, but I am becoming more and more certain that there is some
part he played out here he&rsquo;s anxious to conceal.&nbsp; I
expect you noticed that the beaver-dam in Solomon Creek was gone
and the head of water that came down last night forced out the
booms of pulpwood in the bay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I imagine Gildersleeve would be wild over
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wild is no name for it.&nbsp; Before he left this
morning he spent most of the time cursing everything and
everybody.&nbsp; I think the man was drunk.&nbsp; Anyway, he
insists that the North Star people blew up the dam with dynamite
while the storm was on.&nbsp; But we can&rsquo;t take any action
on mere conjectures.&nbsp; Even if the dam were blown up the
freshet left no clues behind.&nbsp; Our men made a thorough
investigation this morning and could find no proof that the dam
did not give way through natural causes.&nbsp; Now Gildersleeve
swears he&rsquo;s going after the <a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>Dominion government for damages
because we did not have a patrol watching the dam.&nbsp; I
suppose we might have taken that precaution, but no one thought
of danger from that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without proof that the disaster occurred through
preventable causes I don&rsquo;t see how he can produce grounds
for damages,&rdquo; asserted Hammond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; returned the inspector.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Furthermore, Gildersleeve has not from the first dealt on
the square with us or taken us into his confidence.&nbsp;
Off-hand, I&rsquo;d say he appears to me like a man who&rsquo;s
been beaten to it at a game of double-cross where he was as
deep-dyed as the other fellow and now he&rsquo;s aching to take
his spleen out on a third party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But come, Hammond,&rdquo; urged the inspector,
&ldquo;you run along to the dining camp and have a snack of
lunch, and as soon as you get your clothes changed we&rsquo;ll
make a start.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>Sandy Macdougal was glad to see Hammond again, but he appeared
to be particularly out of sorts and uncommunicative this
morning.&nbsp; It was only when Hammond was leaving the dining
camp that he had anything in particular to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t none of my business,&rdquo; he told
Hammond, &ldquo;but if I was asked for any advice, I&rsquo;d say
keep away from that Cup.&nbsp; There ain&rsquo;t anybody white
ever went up there monkeyin&rsquo; around that something
didn&rsquo;t happen they were sorry for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little expedition which set out for the mountain was
composed of Inspector Little, five of his most experienced men,
Lynch the private detective and Louis Hammond.&nbsp; Before they
struck out Inspector Little insisted there was no necessity for
the civilians in the party <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>carrying firearms and used this as
an excuse for relieving Lynch of a murderous-looking
revolver.</p>
<p>Lynch was loud in his protests that as a detective he should
be allowed to carry the weapon, but it did not go with the
inspector.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not carrying a gun myself,&rdquo; he
pointed out.&nbsp; &ldquo;My men are armed and that is all that
is necessary, for they are not liable to shoot unless it is a
case of protecting our lives and their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not only that he sought to guard against unnecessary
bloodshed, but Inspector Little was not any too sure of his
ground in entering the Cup of Nannabijou by means of force.&nbsp;
The police held no warrant for the arrest of any one except
Nathan Stubbs, the pseudo camp preacher, and the doughty
inspector was far from convinced that Stubbs was up in the
Cup.&nbsp; The only pretext on which he felt he could legally
demand the privilege of entering the Cup with an armed force, in
case resistance were offered, was the right to search for the
missing girl, Josephine Stone.</p>
<p>On the other hand, his distrust of Gildersleeve was growing,
along with a conviction that the mysterious happenings on
Nannabijou Limits were far from being what they appeared to be on
the surface.&nbsp; In this latter regard, he was determined not
to be made the catspaw of Gildersleeve through any trickery on
the part of his detective.</p>
<p>The journey up the mountain and along Solomon Creek trail was
made in comparative silence, except for the volubility of Lynch
who bored the patient inspector with wild theories as to what
existed beyond the cliffs of Nannabijou.</p>
<p>When they reached the tunnel that opened out over the rapids
of the creek, Lynch was all impatience to demonstrate his prowess
in showing how the water-gate was operated.&nbsp; He reached up
to the jutting bit of rock and <a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>fumbled for the tiny hole and
inserted a match which he pressed.</p>
<p>There came instantly the mellow alarm of the bell above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cripes, that&rsquo;s sudden action for you,&rdquo; he
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hardly pressed my finger on the match
when the bell rang.&nbsp; It must be set on some sort of
hair-trigger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost immediately the water in the channel dwindled and
ceased to flow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s certainly a novel device,&rdquo; declared
the inspector as he stood with the others of the party staring at
the stream-bed where the last trickle of water had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch while I let it loose again,&rdquo; cried
Lynch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep back, everybody, for she certainly comes
down hell-bent when she&rsquo;s opened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t touch it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector Little and Louis Hammond, certain they caught the
sound of voices somewhere above, yelled it in unison.</p>
<p>But there was no stopping the irrepressible Lynch.&nbsp; The
gong sounded again, followed by the roar of the released
torrent.</p>
<p>From up the channel there came a man&rsquo;s hoarse shout and
the piercing scream of a woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut off the water, you damned idiot!&rdquo; shouted
Inspector Little.</p>
<p>But Lynch, in the excitement, had completely lost his
wits.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t seem able to locate the button
again.</p>
<p>The inspector sprang back and shoved the detective out of the
way while he reached for the projecting match in the hole
himself.</p>
<p>Louis Hammond, at the edge of the raging torrent, stood
transfixed, terrified at what he saw being flung down toward him
on the crest of the maddened tide.</p>

&ldquo;THE MAN THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Unusual</span> commotion below stairs
awakened Josephine Stone at a very early hour the morning
following the storm.&nbsp; She arose and opened the door to
listen.&nbsp; Mrs. Johnson, fully dressed, came down the
hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you getting up, Josephine?&rdquo; she
greeted.&nbsp; &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t intend calling you for an
hour or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the noise.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s going on
downstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know?&nbsp; Why, I was wakened at an
unearthly hour by your Indian maid, Mary.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s back
with us again.&nbsp; She said Mr. Smith told her you were leaving
here to-day and it had been found necessary to make an early
start.&nbsp; I saw Mr. Smith downstairs, and he said there was a
boat waiting at the tunnel at the other end of the Cup to take us
and our belongings back to Amethyst Island.&nbsp; I&mdash;I
thought you knew all about it, Josephine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes&mdash;I had forgotten.&nbsp; Mr. Smith called
last night after you had gone to bed to notify me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you about that terrible-looking Indian
chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;the Medicine Man?&nbsp; What has he done
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, poor man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Killed in the storm last night.&nbsp;
Something terrible must have happened, for the Indians all looked
so <a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>broken up this morning that I asked Mary what was the
matter with them.&nbsp; She said Ogima Bush, their great Medicine
Man, was gone up to the sky and they&rsquo;d never see him
again.&nbsp; All I could get out of her was that he was
&lsquo;making some big medicine&rsquo; whatever that is, and he
was carried away by the storm-devils.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re so
queer, those people, I never can quite understand
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Ogima,&rdquo; breathed Josephine Stone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there was anything so terrible about
him as he painted himself up to look.&nbsp; Sometimes there
seemed to be something terribly tragic in those wicked eyes of
his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, Josie,&rdquo; admonished Mrs. Johnson,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you go getting dressed.&nbsp; Mr. Smith said
it would be all right if you were called an hour from
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Miss Stone had no intention of going back to bed.&nbsp;
She dressed and went downstairs.&nbsp; The Indians were busy
getting baggage ready on the verandah for transportation down to
the boat.</p>
<p>As breakfast wasn&rsquo;t quite ready, Miss Stone strolled
down to the lake.&nbsp; There she was a few minutes later joined
by Acey Smith.&nbsp; He was garbed in his bush clothes and the
personality of the man had undergone one of those undefinable
changes so characteristic of him.&nbsp; Where he had been
buoyant, care-free and boyish the night before he was now
politely formal, inscrutable&mdash;a self-contained Big Boss of
the timberlands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sorry to have had to decide on an early start
without having let you know last night, Miss Stone,&rdquo; he
opened.&nbsp; &ldquo;But about four o&rsquo;clock this morning I
was awakened by a wireless call from the city, notifying me that
some busy-body was having an airman sent over the Cup to-day, so
I decided, if possible, we&rsquo;d leave the Cup before the
air-scout arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More mystery?&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Stone had not exactly
meant to be sarcastic.</p>
<p><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>Acey
Smith gave vent to a low, harsh laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, the
mystery stuff, so far as you are concerned is over,&rdquo; he
assured her.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that brings me to the point I came
down here to speak to you about.&nbsp; This morning after
breakfast, if you feel equal to it, I would like you to take a
walk with me up to the summit of Lookout Cliff
yonder.&rdquo;&nbsp; He pointed to a castle-like formation in the
wall of rock to the east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought we were leaving here this
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are.&nbsp; But while the Indians are taking Mrs.
Johnson and your belongings around to Amethyst Island, I thought
you might let me take you up there to enjoy the wonderful view it
affords while I tell you the story of the North Star and how you
came to be woven into its history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I hear it down at the Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could, but there is an appropriate reason why you
should be shown that view on this, your twenty-first
birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; acceded the girl, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Josephine Stone and Acey Smith made their start for the summit
of Lookout Cliff right after breakfast.&nbsp; The superintendent
appeared with his inevitable packsack strapped on his back, and
after giving final instructions to the Indians, motioned her to
accompany him.</p>
<p>The walk up the gradual ascent through the woods to the foot
of the cliff was refreshing and invigorating, but, after the
custom on northern trails, neither spoke except when it was
absolutely necessary.&nbsp; The man seemed deeply preoccupied and
the girl made no attempt to draw him out of his reverie.</p>
<p>There were moments when to her Acey Smith seemed <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>sublime&mdash;a sort of genie of this wild, wonderful
country.&nbsp; She believed she liked him best in this
mood.&nbsp; In his high boots, corduroys and stetson with its
narrow limp brim slightly turned up off his forehead, he had the
bearing and the mien of some fiercely handsome robber
chieftain.&nbsp; His face, set like a mask, was never turned
toward her; his eyes seemed always fixed on the trail
above.&nbsp; She found herself walking in his wake, quite as
naturally as the Indian woman trails after her brave in their
journeys through the wild.</p>
<p>They paused for a few moments&rsquo; rest at the base of the
cliff before starting the ascent of the winding pathway that led
to the summit.&nbsp; Suddenly a rapidly-vibrating roaring sound
broke in upon them from the upper air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The airplane has arrived,&rdquo; commented Acey Smith,
pointing to the machine swooping over the cliffs at the
water-gate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just a little too late to find out
anything worth while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you suppose it is?&rdquo; asked the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a government machine sent to locate
you.&nbsp; I think likely it&rsquo;s been put on the job at the
request of your friend, Mr. Hammond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He watched her covertly as the colour came and went in her
cheeks at the mention of Hammond&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hammond!&rdquo; she gasped.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, then,
we must go back and send word to him that I am safe and
sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it will not be necessary,&rdquo; he declared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Hammond will be none the worse for a few hours&rsquo;
suspense.&nbsp; You will meet him before the sun sets to-night,
and you will then be the better able to explain
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he still down at the limits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think he&rsquo;s back, though the last news I
had of him he was in Kam City.&nbsp; He had a falling out with <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>Norman T.
Gildersleeve and quit the services of the International
Investment outfit.&nbsp; I expect he discovered they
weren&rsquo;t altogether the innocent angels they pretended to
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused a moment, then: &ldquo;Hammond is what
few men of ability are nowadays&mdash;clean-cut and honest to the
core.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl dropped her eyes to hide the gratitude that welled up
in them.&nbsp; What had it cost Acey Smith to make that
magnanimous statement?&nbsp; For she knew now that he knew what
she could not give to him would be Hammond&rsquo;s for the
asking.</p>
<p>They watched the plane make a landing, saw the airman examine
the grounds and buildings, then re-enter his machine and fly away
over the cliffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently thought better of staying overlong in the
Cup,&rdquo; commented Acey Smith.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, well, there
was nothing for him to fear; my men have instructions to molest
no one coming here from now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that the Cup will no longer be a secret
retreat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That all depends; it is a matter now for some one else
to decide,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go on up
to the top.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>The summit of Lookout Cliff offered a wonderful view on this
clear day of the lake and the forests below.&nbsp; Nannabijou
camp from there seemed a tiny gash in a world of wilderness; the
river and Solomon Creek silver threads winding down to
Superior.&nbsp; On the outer side the cliff descended, a sheer
wall, five hundred feet to the woods on the side of the mountain,
the elevation being one thousand seven hundred and fifty feet
above sea-level.&nbsp; The cliff is known among sailormen of the
Great Lakes as the highest piece of land on the North Shore.</p>
<p><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>&ldquo;This pinnacle,&rdquo; Acey Smith was saying,
&ldquo;was held sacred by the pagan Indians as the eerie of the
Thunder Eagle, a demi-god supposed to rule the land and the water
as far as his eyes could see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It therefore did not seem unfitting,&rdquo; he
continued quietly, &ldquo;to bring you to this spot to declare
you, as I do now, undisputed mistress of the North
Shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him thoroughly bewildered, for the moment unable
to think what answer to make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you there would be no mystery after
to-day,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and what I am about to tell you
is bald fact.&nbsp; To-day, on your twenty-first birthday, Miss
Josephine Stone, you become heir to the estate of your
grandfather, Joseph Stone, and that estate now includes all the
holdings of the North Star Towing and Contracting Company and the
controlling share in all its various subsidiaries.&nbsp; In
compliance with the dying injunction of your grandfather, the
ownership of those properties has been transferred to your name,
where they were formerly held in trust by myself and the
executives of the North Star for you under the pseudonym of
&lsquo;J.C.X.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t understand all this,&rdquo; she
murmured in perplexity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grandfather, I always
understood, was not very wealthy.&nbsp; He was merely a
prospector and scientist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied her companion, &ldquo;and in what
you do not understand lies the story&mdash;a story in which
I&rsquo;m afraid I will have to tell altogether too much about
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please <i>do</i> tell me,&rdquo; she urged.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am sure I will be deeply interested in that very part of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s step over yonder where we will be
sheltered from the breeze and still have the benefit of the
sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>Acey
Smith unslung his pack and hung it by one of the straps on the
bough of a stunted jackpine whose roots somehow drew sustenance
from a crevice near the edge of the cliff.&nbsp; He led the girl
to a seat on a moss-covered ledge and himself sat down facing
her.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>The superintendent placed a cigarette in a holder and lit
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story,&rdquo; he opened, &ldquo;should properly
start with the advent of John Carlstone here half a century
ago.&nbsp; &lsquo;Black Jack&rsquo; Carlstone, as he was known,
was an eastern Canadian, the second generation of the old pioneer
school and a mixture of the romantic races that migrated to the
Niagara Peninsula from the valley of the Mississippi in the
States&mdash;English, Welsh, Dutch and Irish blood ran in his
veins.&nbsp; He was a tall, powerfully-built, black-whiskered
demon of a man, with a heart as great as his physical
dimensions&mdash;a man who was known to recognise no such
elements as difficulty or danger.&nbsp; He was a born trader, the
particular type that made good and amassed fortunes in those
tremendous days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Carlstone located near a trading-post which then
thrived on what is now the site of Kam City, and it was not long
before he was identified with almost every undertaking in which
there was money to be made, bartering with the Indians for furs,
getting out timber and building wharfs and roads for the
government.&nbsp; There were few white women in the North in
those days, and John Carlstone took as his wife the daughter of
an Indian chief who was headman of all the North Shore tribes,
and, standing little on ceremony, was married under the pagan
rites of the Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the birth of his son there came two heavy blows <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>to John
Carlstone.&nbsp; He lost his wife, and her child was cursed with
an infirmity that came of a prenatal accident.&nbsp; In moments
of stress or high nervous excitement, the boy would be overcome
with a strange paroxysm and cry out with the weird, unearthly
call of the northern loon.&nbsp; But this son, despite his
infirmity and the fact that he inherited a skin the colour of his
mother&rsquo;s race, was the apple of John Carlstone&rsquo;s
eye.&nbsp; He named him Alexander, because, as he told the boy
when he grew older, &lsquo;Alexander was a conqueror, and you
must conquer all this wild North Shore some day.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
was a remark that afterwards rang in the consciousness of
Alexander Carlstone with all the glamour of prophecy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young Carlstone was from the first a dreamer of wild
dreams of power&mdash;a boy apart and an albino among his
playmates.&nbsp; Timid, studious and extremely sensitive in the
beginning, the ridicule of his fellows begot the first bitterness
that was later to engulf his whole better nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The elder Carlstone&rsquo;s wealth grew and grew.&nbsp;
He became the owner of a modest fleet of lake boats and a string
of inland trading-posts.&nbsp; Dissatisfied with the progress he
was making in the crude pioneer school, Carlstone sent his son
east to be educated at a private college, where the lad, under a
sympathetic teacher, went far and quickly in his studies.&nbsp;
He grew to know that he had inherited his father&rsquo;s
initiative and force of character along with an abnormal gift for
grasping and visualising situations that baffled the analyses of
others.&nbsp; The father planned to make a great merchant or
business man of him; the son dreamed of becoming a star on the
stage.&nbsp; Young Alexander Carlstone knew that the fire that
burned in his veins was the fire of a born protagonist.&nbsp; But
he hid this ambition from his father and even his teacher; he
felt he must first overcome the affliction that had clung to him
since birth.</p>
<p><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>&ldquo;While his son was away at school the elder
Carlstone married again, this time to the widow of Captain Norman
Gildersleeve, who had been master of one of Carlstone&rsquo;s
boats.&nbsp; She was a designing, unscrupulous woman, and she
brought with her a son, some years older than Carlstone&rsquo;s,
who inherited all his mother&rsquo;s malicious and covetous
nature.&nbsp; But with John Carlstone&rsquo;s undying affection
for his son, the influence of the Gildersleeves might not have
cut much figure in the latter&rsquo;s life had it not been for a
whim of Fate and the Law&mdash;the damnable travesty on Justice
that men call the Law.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Young Carlstone had completed what would be the
equivalent of a modern public and high school education when one
day there came the most unfortunate moment of his life with
tidings of the death of his father, the one true friend who
believed in him and would have sacrificed all for him right or
wrong.&nbsp; The elder Carlstone was drowned out of a canoe
during a storm on one of the inland lakes; the wilderness from
which he had won affluence and wealth swallowed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the crucial turning-point in the life of young
Alexander Carlstone, the end of the dramatic career which he had
dreamed of&mdash;the last chapter in the life of the Man That
Might Have Been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owing to the lack of telegraph service across Canada at
that time, the news of his father&rsquo;s passing was almost a
week in reaching the young man.&nbsp; The latter was out of funds
and none had been sent him.&nbsp; His big-hearted teacher,
touched by the anguished grief of his pupil, advanced the cost of
his transportation home, though young Carlstone read in his moist
old eyes a something that was prescient of worse woes to
come.</p>
<p><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>&ldquo;Alexander Carlstone arrived at Kam City to find
the doors of his father&rsquo;s house closed against him.&nbsp;
Norman T. Gildersleeve, son of the woman who was John
Carlstone&rsquo;s second wife, came out and ordered him off the
premises.&nbsp; An altercation followed, in the heat of which
Gildersleeve cried:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get out of here, you tramp; get out or
I&rsquo;ll send for the provincial police to throw you out!&nbsp;
You have no claim here&mdash;you are nameless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A presentiment of just what his dark words meant
staggered Carlstone for the moment.&nbsp; &lsquo;Say that
again!&rsquo; he defied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll say it,&rsquo; mocked the
other.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are a nobody, and in the eyes of the Law
you are not John Carlstone&rsquo;s heir.&nbsp; Your mother was
merely his squaw mistress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that taunt, young Carlstone saw all red.&nbsp; He
bore down upon Gildersleeve with the fury of a savage and struck
as his fighting father would have struck.&nbsp; Gildersleeve went
over before a terrific blow that laid his cheek open below the
right eye.&nbsp; When he struggled to his feet he was knocked
down again with a similar smash under the left optic.&nbsp; As he
lay upon the ground, his face covered with blood, Carlstone stood
over him uttering the terrible cry that since infancy had
afflicted him in moments of high excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his blind fury, young Carlstone might have finished
for good the usurper of his birthrights had it not been that
passersby intervened.&nbsp; As it was, he left two scars upon the
face of Norman T. Gildersleeve that he was to carry all his
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josephine Stone shuddered.&nbsp; It was not altogether at the
recital of the details of the fight, but at remembrance of those
very scars beneath the eyes of the man she had seen with Louis
Hammond that night on the <a name="page288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>transcontinental train.&nbsp; She
did not interrupt, however, as Acey Smith proceeded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alexander Carlstone was placed under arrest and tried
before the district magistrate on a charge of felonious assault
with intent to kill.&nbsp; The district attorney was a fair man,
and in view of the provocation, reduced the charge to common
assault and battery.&nbsp; The magistrate, a born snob and the
voluntary creature of the now powerful Gildersleeve family,
imposed a fine of fifty dollars, in default of which young
Carlstone was to spend six months in jail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Staunch old friends of John Carlstone came to the
rescue of his unfortunate son.&nbsp; They engaged a lawyer to
defend him, and when he was sentenced, they supplied his fine
that he might not have to bear the further ignominy of spending a
term in jail.&nbsp; They even went further and started to raise a
fund to defray the legal expenses of a fight for his rights in
the courts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it turned out that what Norman T. Gildersleeve had
said was based on the Law&mdash;the Law which was made to crush
the souls of the unfortunate and to protect the smug hypocrites
who revere it and Gold as their established gods.&nbsp; John
Carlstone&rsquo;s first marriage to an Indian chief&rsquo;s
daughter, under the red man&rsquo;s rites, was not recognised by
Church or State; the son therefore was nameless and had no rights
under the Constitution.&nbsp; The further fact that John
Carlstone had neglected to make a will left the younger
Carlstone&rsquo;s case hopeless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alexander Carlstone fled from the haunts of
civilisation, filled with a consuming bitterness of spirit, an
atheist so far as garbled Justice and revamped Christianity were
concerned and nursing an undying hatred for the usurper, Norman
T. Gildersleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his soul had been sown the self-same germs that have
bred history&rsquo;s bloodiest revolutions.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
&ldquo;THE MAN THAT WAS&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Joseph Stone</span>, your
grandfather, was one of those vitally interested in the fate of
young Carlstone,&rdquo; continued Acey Smith.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
old scientist and prospector had been a personal cronie of John
Carlstone; in fact, the latter had been of financial assistance
to him in some of his early ventures.&nbsp; But in his eerie out
here in the Cup of Nannabijou, where he lived to himself, Joseph
Stone did not learn of his friend&rsquo;s death and the
disappearance of his son until he made one of his periodical
visits to the city for supplies.&nbsp; The old man was deeply
grieved and made diligent inquiry for the whereabouts of
Alexander Carlstone, but the young man had then been away several
weeks and none knew whither he had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph Stone was himself a heart-hungry old man, his
own only son having left him during an altercation in which the
younger Stone had insisted on their leaving the wilderness for
the western prairies where he saw a more prosperous future for
both.&nbsp; The upshot of it all was that the son left for the
West, swearing that he would never darken his father&rsquo;s door
again.&nbsp; And he never did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be stated that your grandfather, though a
learned and open-hearted man, was extremely eccentric in some
respects.&nbsp; He had invested almost all of his modest fortune
in equipping a laboratory in this faraway <a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>fastness.&nbsp; He managed somehow to eke out a living
by engaging in trapping in the cold months and occasionally doing
exploring and investigating work in the then little known
interior for the government.&nbsp; His passion, however, was for
scientific research, and his one ruling hobby was to discover the
answer to the riddle of pigmentation whereby the colour is
transmitted to the bodies and faces of the dark-skinned races of
men.&nbsp; His theory was that black, red, brown and yellow men
were so because of the prevalence of a tiny germ secreted in the
intricacies of the cuticle, and that this germ while alive
resisted the bleaching effects of the actinic rays of the
sun&rsquo;s light.&nbsp; He not only pursued his research in this
matter to a successful conclusion, but actually produced a
formula for a solution, which, when applied to the skin, killed
the active colour germs, so that only a few moments of exposure
to the sunlight, after treatment, would turn dark men or red men
white.&nbsp; Fortunately or unfortunately, as the case may have
been, his secret died with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was through the pursuit of these experiments and an
Indian witch-doctor, who was none other than our friend, Ogima
Bush, that Joseph Stone quite unexpectededly came in contact with
the lost Alexander Carlstone.&nbsp; The medicine men among the
tribes and some of the more exalted chiefs were the only Indians
that would dare enter the sacred Cup of Nannabijou to visit the
white magician as they called him.&nbsp; Ogima the crafty was a
frequent caller.&nbsp; Joseph Stone cultivated him because the
Indian witch-doctor was something of an uncanny chemist himself
in a primitive way, though there are secrets among the medicine
men of the pagan tribes that it is better for the white
man&rsquo;s morals and peace of mind that he should never dabble
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It so happened that when Joseph Stone had completed his
formula for bleaching the skin that he wanted <a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>to
experiment on Ogima, but to his intense surprise the Medicine Man
became very indignant at the suggestion.&nbsp; Why should he or
any of his people wish to be white?&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t the red
man of more noble lineage and the very colour of his skin
emblematic of the superior favours the sun-god had conferred upon
him?&nbsp; Any such trifling, he declared, would bring a curse
upon his people, and he would see that they had none of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Medicine Man&rsquo;s word was law among the
Indians, and Joseph Stone was in despair of finding a living
subject for experimentation until, one day, Ogima, after a long
smoke by the fireplace in the cabin, made the announcement that
he had discovered a young man among the bands who should have
been born white, and if Stone wished to try his witchcraft on
this young man, Ogima would send him to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scientist was perplexed at the Indian&rsquo;s
sudden change of front.&nbsp; He suspected some extraordinary
favour would be extracted in return; but Ogima&rsquo;s only
pronouncement was that once he was changed to white the young man
in question must remain so and must no longer call himself an
Indian.&nbsp; He left abruptly with a promise that he would go
immediately in search of the subject.&nbsp; In three mornings he
predicted the young man would be waiting in the tunnel below the
water-gate which was then operated by hand on a given signal from
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the third morning what was Joseph Stone&rsquo;s
amazement and delight to discover that the young man sent him by
Ogima Bush was none other than Alexander Carlstone, son of his
deceased benefactor.&nbsp; Carlstone subsequently told him that
since he had left Kam City he had been living among the Indians
of his mother&rsquo;s tribe, and on account of her lineage he had
been created a chief or headman of the band.&nbsp; But these
honours had <a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>brought no joys; supreme discontent had gnawed at him
always.&nbsp; The red man&rsquo;s ways, he found, were not his
ways, and he wanted to be away doing more useful things; to have
his white man&rsquo;s sagacity and ambition pitted against
problems and difficulties life among those primitive people did
not offer.&nbsp; He had come to regard himself with supreme
self-pity as neither a white man nor a savage; as an outcast from
the former and a lonely, discontented demi-god among the
latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not burden you with a detailed account of what
followed, Miss Stone,&rdquo; Acey Smith went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
experiment was gone on with at once, but by degrees, Carlstone
first submitting his hands and face to the solution.&nbsp; When
it was over and he surveyed himself in a glass he could scarcely
believe it was himself that was reflected there, the
metamorphosis was so great.&nbsp; Thus transformed, and wearing
white man&rsquo;s apparel, young Carlstone went back among the
Indians, pretending to be a trapper lost in the woods.&nbsp; His
real identity was suspected by none of the tribe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The realisation of what this change might mean inspired
Alexander Carlstone with the first hazy elements of what
afterwards became a daring scheme.&nbsp; He was filled with a
savage rejoicing that came not entirely from vanity over his
white skin, but from the knowledge that this transformation would
make him unrecognisable as Alexander Carlstone, the outcast of
civilisation.&nbsp; At the bottom of it all, though he himself
did not fully realise it at the time, was a restless ambition, a
consuming desire for power and the opportunity to exert that
power to avenge his wrongs.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I once contended with you,&rdquo; continued the man to
whom Josephine Stone listened as one in a dream, &ldquo;that <a
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>there is in
all of us at least two personalities&mdash;the Man That Is and
the Man That Might Have Been.&nbsp; The Man That Is is the man
begot of environment and circumstances; the Man That Might Have
Been is the ideal we cherished in hopeful youth.&nbsp; For it is
circumstance that fashions our careers for us, no matter how
cozy-corner philosophers may argue to the contrary, just as the
hills and harder rock formations divert the courses of streams in
their search for yonder lake and the ultimate sea.&nbsp;
Oftentimes, an even-flowing, placid stream is thus suddenly
transformed into a turbulent rapids, dealing destruction to all
that enters the path of its fury.&nbsp; The analogy holds good
with humankind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this case, Alexander Carlstone, who had dreamed of
becoming a famous actor in the world of the mimic drama, became
Acey Smith the Timber Pirate, a protagonist in a drama of real
life, always with a grim climax of revenge in view.&nbsp; As I
see it now, I have always been acting a self-proscribed part,
putting into it the same intensity I might have otherwise
concentrated on the theatrical stage.&nbsp; Acey Smith is the man
that was made by circumstances&mdash;the Man That Is.&nbsp; For,
as you have no doubt surmised, Miss Stone, I was first Alexander
Carlstone and afterwards Acey Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all this is digression.&nbsp; I did not at once set
out to accomplish the ambition that burned within me.&nbsp;
Instead, I dreamed and planned and plotted while I studied in the
library of Joseph Stone.&nbsp; Dimly, I believe, there was always
a plan of action somewhere hidden in my back mind, but the road
to its interpretation was continuous, concentrated mental
drudgery.&nbsp; The element of accident has done more to solve
men&rsquo;s problems than so-called inspirations; it remained for
subsequent circumstances to point the way to my goal for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph Stone told me of a simple tablet, that, <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>dissolved
in the mouth, would prevent the loon-cry that rose in my throat
in moments of excitement, a remedy which I have since always kept
by me.&nbsp; Meanwhile, in the r&ocirc;le of a white trapper, I
made frequent trips to Kam City, which had by then grown to the
status of quite a thriving northern town, with a lake port whose
future was unquestioned.&nbsp; It was to be the gateway between
the East and the wheat-producing West just then opening up in
full earnest.&nbsp; In bitterness I saw the opportunity and
wealth that might have been mine; in double bitterness I
discovered that the usurper, Gildersleeve, had become the leading
man of the place and owned and controlled nearly all the
important commercial undertakings in the town.&nbsp; One day I
passed him on the street and was thrilled that he did not
recognise me.&nbsp; I had no inclination to set upon him.&nbsp;
My own calmness under the circumstances amazed me.&nbsp; I could
wait, something within me seemed to whisper; my time would
come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph Stone was biding his time about giving his
discovery to the world.&nbsp; I was living proof of its
efficiency, but there was one other thing he wished for before he
set out to make all the races of the world white, and that was
independent financial means.&nbsp; For the accomplishment of this
dream he depended on a rumour that came to him of indications of
a rich gold mine far in the interior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in the late autumn of my twentieth year that
Joseph Stone and I set out to locate the gold vein that he
believed existed far up the Nannabijou River.&nbsp; We took no
guides and travelled light, for to both of us the wilderness was
an open book.&nbsp; To be brief, after a month of the pack-trail
and patient prospecting, we did discover the gold vein, which
gave indications far beyond the expectations of either.</p>
<p><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>&ldquo;But winter came down with the sudden intensity
which is often its wont in the North.&nbsp; We were awakened one
night by the cold and the howling of a raging blizzard.&nbsp; We
decided to set out on the return journey at once, particularly on
account of a shortage of vegetables and flour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the rivers and lakes were frozen over, we had to
abandon our canoe, and, as we had brought no snowshoes with us,
the going through the fine, loose snow was exceedingly hard on
the old man.&nbsp; Joseph Stone, I could see, was gradually
breaking down under the hardships of the gruelling journey and
the assaults of the cold.&nbsp; A cough he had developed and the
deepening shadows under his eyes were symptoms of the dreaded
grippe.&nbsp; Day by day his inertia increased until he finally
pitched over and begged me to let him go to his last sleep in the
snow while I pushed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was carrying him on my back rolled up in blankets
when I fortunately came upon a band of roving Indians, from whom
I borrowed a string of dogs, a sled and a pair of
snowshoes.&nbsp; Thus equipped, after I had gone back up the
trail and secured the provisions and equipment we had cached when
Stone broke down, I bundled the sick man up on the sled and made
haste to reach the cabin in the Cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph Stone breathed his last one night on the trail
within a day&rsquo;s journey of home.&nbsp; Just before he died
he cried out:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>You won&rsquo;t forget, the mine goes
to</i>&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then his voice failed him, but what I caught when I
bent near was a whispered, &lsquo;<i>to J&mdash; C&mdash; when
twenty-one</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With his last breath he called upon the spirit of my
father, &lsquo;Black Jack&rsquo; Carlstone, to witness the
injunction he had made to me.</p>
<p><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>&ldquo;It was in my subsequent reflections standing
there in the trail by the dead man that a mad inspiration as to
the course of my future operations came to me in a flash.&nbsp;
From Joseph Stone I had previously learned the story of his
son&rsquo;s leaving him in white anger years before.&nbsp; The
father had never forgiven what he deemed ingratitude, and he
apparently never heard from the younger Stone again until his
widow wrote of his death and the subsequent birth of a daughter,
who had been named in her grandfather&rsquo;s honour, Josephine
Stone.&nbsp; Joseph Stone never answered that letter, but he
cherished the picture of the baby the mother had sent with it,
and, as he always referred to the child as &lsquo;Josie,&rsquo;
there was never any doubt that his whispered &lsquo;<i>J&mdash;
C&mdash;</i>&rsquo; was meant to be Josie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was like the eccentric old scientist to thus give
out his last orders.&nbsp; His oral will that the property was
not to go to his grand-daughter until she was twenty-one might
ordinarily have presented legal difficulties; but to me that
injunction presented the opportunity that comes to a man but once
in a lifetime, if it comes at all.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I went back to civilisation as &lsquo;A. C.
Smith,&rsquo; using my actual initials as a prefix to a pseudonym
I felt would stir up the least curiosity.&nbsp; Part of my plan
of future operations was to keep my own personality as much in
the background as possible.&nbsp; I also devised the pseudonym,
&lsquo;J.C.X.,&rsquo; to represent Josephine Stone until she
became of age and heiress to the estate, but to have a legal
significance as a trust account in the bank it had to be made
&lsquo;J. C. Eckes.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was in favour of J.C.X. that
I filed the claim on the gold mine property, giving it out that I
was acting for this other party who wished to be <a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>identified
as little as possible with the transactions and had left me the
authority to take care of them.&nbsp; The drafting up of a
fictitious written agreement to this effect caused me no qualms
of conscience, for I had long since lost any reverence I might
have held for legal technicalities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The following summer the mining claim was sold for
thirty-five thousand dollars.&nbsp; It was more than it
subsequently proved to be worth, for the vein was only a shallow
out-cropping.&nbsp; But fortune was already playing into my
hands, for Norman T. Gildersleeve, who was one of the heaviest
shareholders in the company that bought it, lost a lot of money
developing it.&nbsp; Through the mine, unexpectedly, I had dealt
him his first blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thirty-five thousand dollars brought the North
Star Towing and Contracting Company into existence as a
one-tug-and-barge concern.&nbsp; As Acey Smith, a man from
nowhere, I became its skipper and general outdoors executive, but
its actual ownership in the name of J.C.X. was known only to its
bankers.&nbsp; The general public believed it was backed by a
syndicate of eastern capitalists, a delusion I took every means
to foster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The North Star prospered from the start.&nbsp; From
then on its progress was like that of a thing of destiny.&nbsp;
Gildersleeve, who, with his associates, had until now almost a
complete monopoly of marine work, at first paid little attention
to the insignificant North Star.&nbsp; He was then more concerned
with city real estate and western land ventures.&nbsp; It was not
until it was announced that a leading Kam City citizen, holding
the patronage from Ottawa, had been appointed president of the
North Star that he became at all alarmed.&nbsp; What he did not
fully realise was that this political trickster and professional
lobbyist had been bought body and soul for the use of his name
and his influence at the capital.&nbsp; He was merely a dummy
president, as all the presidents of the North <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>Star since
have been, with no more real executive authority than the man in
the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Gildersleeve woke up too late.&nbsp; His first cold
realisation that he had a dangerous rival came when the North
Star secured a huge government contract for harbour dredging and
improvements, for which an appropriation of two million dollars
had been placed in the parliamentary estimates.&nbsp; With the
money credit established by the acquisition of this contract, the
North Star was enabled to invest in a formidable fleet of tugs
and the most modern dredging equipment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no stopping now&mdash;the North Star&rsquo;s
only salvation lay in continuous expansion to the last shred of
money credit and the gobbling up of every worthwhile
contract.&nbsp; High capitalisation and enormous daily overhead
had to be met with tremendous production and what the newspapers
call profiteering on a large scale.&nbsp; There is an advanced
stage of development of a commercial enterprise when its
directing head must chloroform his conscience.&nbsp; The North
Star had reached that stage.&nbsp; It was a case of destroying or
being destroyed.&nbsp; The war between the North Star and the
Gildersleeve interests was on in deadly earnest, and I saw to it
that the North Star was continuously the aggressor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gildersleeve was no fool as a business man, and under
his smug cloak of respectability he knew no scruples save where
the law might halt him.&nbsp; But, as his potential destroyer, I
had made a thorough, patient study of his weaknesses rather than
his strength.&nbsp; He had so long been used to easy, safe stages
of progress that he had lost the initiative of a plunger.&nbsp;
He considered too long and was over-cautious; while Gildersleeve
was <a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>holding long-winded conferences with his associates and
executives, the North Star was striking hard where it was least
expected to strike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through a thoroughly organised private intelligence
department, I knew the Gildersleeve plans before they were put
into operation.&nbsp; The North Star too held conferences; but
they were merely &lsquo;blinds,&rsquo; the plans of the company
being devised by none but myself, and none knew what they were
until orders went out to the president over the signature of
&lsquo;J.C.X.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I picked my men for their ability to carry out
instructions quickly and thoroughly.&nbsp; I had no need for
generals or advisors; except that their recommendations regarding
campaign plans gave me an idea what other people, including our
competitors, would be liable to conceive we were about to
do.&nbsp; If such recommendations tallied with the plans already
formulated, I promptly discarded the latter and set about
devising entirely different methods.&nbsp; The North Star never
did the obvious thing, and the element of surprise invariably
helped carry the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The North Star took a controlling interest in powerful
newspapers it could use, and it used their news columns and
editorials in a subtle manner that never gave them the appearance
of mere organs.&nbsp; To be a power in the land and so many
stuffed clubs to drive the politicians to do the North
Star&rsquo;s bidding, they had to be papers of the people and
with the people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general conception that a mysterious outside
personality directed the affairs of the North Star had become a
fixed make-believe with myself.&nbsp; I actually used to come
here to the cabin in the Cup to &lsquo;consult&rsquo; the
fictitious J.C.X., playing upon the violin the music that was
<i>en rapport</i> with my mood.&nbsp; And with the music would
come flashes of inspiration from what I held to <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>myself was
the unseen agency of J.C.X.&nbsp; It was whimsical, childish, if
you like, but one must so pamper the sub-conscious if he would
have it function.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The North Star&rsquo;s great smash was the capture of
the government ice-breaking contracts for spring and fall, which
the Gildersleeve interests held until we had J. J. Slack elected
to the Commons, elevated to the cabinet and made him our
president.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The North Star gave Gildersleeve no quarter.&nbsp; A
series of other swiftly-succeeding coups broke the back of
Gildersleeve&rsquo;s control on the upper Lakes.&nbsp; Soon his
boats were lying idle at their docks, and when in a tight year
they were offered for sale at what would be little better than
their value as junk, the North Star secretly financed other small
companies to buy up the best of them, in order to make sure there
would not even be crumbs left for its rival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The North Star had gained undisputed monopoly of the
Upper Lakes, and it now turned its attention to inland
activities, seeking where it could strike Gildersleeve most
vitally.&nbsp; It became a byword that the unknown clique who
guided the North Star could make and break other men and
businesses at its pleasure.&nbsp; Politicians and the so-called
rulers of the land came seeking the North Star ready to do its
pleasure.&nbsp; It seems to be a fact that the mob respect and
fear only that which remains a profound mystery to them.&nbsp;
The unsolved riddle of the North Star&rsquo;s ownership and
direction inspired a morale among its executives and workers that
familiarity with the master mind of the enterprise would have
negatived.&nbsp; Its operations and swift expansion to the
exclusion of others came to be looked upon with a sort of numbed
fatalism by its rivals and enemies.&nbsp; It seemed to
appropriate with ease what it willed on land and water; but none
knew the continuous drudgery of one man&rsquo;s <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>imagination
to bring about those very things.&nbsp; And the North Star
fostered and preserved an element of colour that distinguished it
from the drab grind of most big business undertakings&mdash;it
was picturesque as well as successful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the year 1914, when the Great War broke out, the
North Star had driven Norman T. Gildersleeve from every holding
he had originally usurped in the estate of John Carlstone, and
from other enterprises he held stock in in Canada.&nbsp; He fled
to the States, a bankrupt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have given you a cold-blooded story of how the North
Star succeeded.&nbsp; Its operations were on a plane with those
of nearly every big enterprise in Canada to-day.&nbsp; Big
business is war, always war&mdash;smash or be smashed.&nbsp; But
the North Star hid behind no smug cloak of hypocrisy; it gave no
quarter and it asked for none.&nbsp; On the other hand, the North
Star lived up to its contracts to the letter; it never swindled a
legitimate customer nor took advantage of a weak or struggling
competitor.&nbsp; Its sole prey was the Gildersleeve interests
and those who stood in the way of its becoming great and
powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>&ldquo;And now I must go back to a detail that I would much
rather not have to touch upon,&rdquo; said Acey Smith.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But in this account of my stewardship, I promised you I
should leave no mystery unexplained, and had not this little
matter been attended to I would feel I had been remiss in my
duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time after the North Star enterprise had been
successfully placed on its feet I had a trusted agent locate the
whereabouts of Josephine Stone and her mother.&nbsp; He brought
back a report that they were living <a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>in Calgary, and that the death of
the heiress&rsquo; father had left them poorly provided
for.&nbsp; Joseph Stone&rsquo;s eccentric will left no
alternative in the matter of supplying funds direct from the
earnings of his estate to her until she had reached her
twenty-first birthday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How to supply you with an annuity that would provide
for your livelihood and education without leaving it open to
discovery where the money came from was one of the most
perplexing problems of all I set out to solve.&nbsp; The
discovery that your father had been manager of a wholesale
produce concern in Edmonton before his health broke down and that
he had invented a secret method for preserving eggs for
indefinite periods without the use of salt finally gave me an
idea.&nbsp; A man was sent to make your mother an offer for the
recipe.&nbsp; Fortunately, she had preserved the formula, and she
seemed only too delighted to dispose of it to the Kam City Cold
Storage Company at a royalty of three thousand dollars a
year.&nbsp; It was as much as I dared make the royalty
lest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josephine Stone gave a little gasp at thus suddenly learning
the real source of the income she and her mother had
enjoyed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And we had thought that all came of
father&rsquo;s genius!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wait,&rdquo; interposed Acey Smith.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s invention earned fifty times what the
royalty cost each year.&nbsp; The Kam City Cold Storage Company
is one of the flourishing subsidiaries of the North Star, and
your father&rsquo;s recipe for storing eggs is used in it
to-day.&nbsp; It was the recipe which actually contributed most
to its success.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>CHAPTER XXVII<br />
AT THE MEETING OF THE TRAILS</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Josephine Stone</span> sat a rapt listener
to this, the first relation of the inner story of the North Star
Towing and Contracting Company&rsquo;s operations.&nbsp; She had
only grasped in a dazed way the tremendous significance it had to
her personally.&nbsp; The magnetic nearness of the master mind
that had created and developed the huge enterprise and its
subsidiaries single-handed diverted her thoughts for the time
being from her own personal interest in the matter.&nbsp; Here
close to her was that rare type, a man of dreams with the will
and initiative to weave reality from the gossamer skeins of his
picturesque imagination&mdash;a genius and a man of purpose.</p>
<p>The thought that struck her was: What must this man have gone
through in all those years!&nbsp; He had not referred to
that.&nbsp; His stress had been on the might and achievements of
the North Star.&nbsp; But the North Star was Acey Smith; a
man&rsquo;s greatest achievements in life are no more than the
expression and embodiment of the hidden emotions that rule his
being.&nbsp; These things must have come, not alone from the
desire for revenge on his usurper, but from the irresistible urge
of a great protagonist soul for self-expression&mdash;the
consciousness of power&mdash;the restless fire that consumes a
conqueror.&nbsp; What might this man not have been under other
circumstances?</p>
<p>She glanced shyly at his face as he proceeded in low, musical
tones with the tale.&nbsp; The bitter, sinister lines <a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>were gone
from it now, and in their place there sat the tragedy of it all;
the lonely years he struggled and fought and pitted himself
against the giants of his time&mdash;anonymously, because of his
terrible affliction, that loon-cry, and the calamitous
circumstances of his birth.&nbsp; About those unhappy features,
she intuitively knew, he was extremely sensitive&mdash;secret
sorrows that until now had been sealed books.&nbsp; He had dared
have no sympathetic confidante and no solace in his periods of
relaxation but the voice of his violin up in the solitary
confines of this Cup of Nannabijou.&nbsp; Now&mdash;now she
understood that terrible heart-hunger that had wailed to her on
the notes of the number he played last night.</p>
<p>But there was that yet that she had not learned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When war broke out and Canada offered her all in the
cause of civilisation,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;I experienced
the thrill that gripped the manhood of British nations round the
world.&nbsp; I wanted to get in on a bit of the fighting, and I
wanted to fight under my father&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; I found a
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instructions went out to the executives of the North
Star that the directing heads of the company were called away
temporarily on war duty, and Hon. J. J. Slack was put in absolute
charge in the interim.&nbsp; A. C. Smith, superintendent, it was
announced, was being despatched on confidential business and
would be absent from his duties for an indefinite period, his
chief assistant taking care of his work in the meantime.&nbsp;
This all looked plausible enough because two of the North
Star&rsquo;s most powerful tugs had been sent overseas when the
first call for boats of their type went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I enlisted I left a sealed envelope containing
explicit instructions as to the disposition of the affairs of the
North Star, in case I did not return, with Sir David
Edwards-Jones, president of the Regal Bank of <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>Canada, a
man I had grown to estimate as the soul of thoroughness and
honour.&nbsp; Those instructions were to be returned to me with
the seals unbroken if I did come back.&nbsp; Then one night,
unnoticed, I took a midnight train for the West.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stained my skin the copper tint it had been before
old Joseph Stone bleached it with his formula, and in Vancouver
enlisted as Private Alexander Carlstone.&nbsp; None that knew me
as Acey Smith knew my name, number or battalion except Yvonne
Kovenay, a rather wonderful young woman who was head of the North
Star&rsquo;s intelligence department.&nbsp; I confided that much
to her, under pledges of strictest secrecy, in order that I might
be kept in touch with the affairs of the North Star while I was
at the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what you told me that day on Amethyst Island, Miss
Stone, I gather that you have heard most there was to know about
the record of Alexander Carlstone with the Canadian army; except
that the story as it was passed on by others gives me much more
credit for deeds of valour than is coming to me.&nbsp; How I
slipped away unnoticed from the base hospital and reverted to the
role of Acey Smith is a little story in itself, but we have no
time for those details now.&nbsp; The fighting was almost over
and I wanted to get back to Canada as quickly as possible, lest
in the process of demobilisation my identity should be
learned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incidentally, news had come to me that Gildersleeve was
organising a new company to enter into competition with the North
Star&rsquo;s pulpwood activities along the North
Shore.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Before the war, the North Star had succeeded in
acquiring all the larger and more valuable timber <a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>concessions
on the upper reaches of Lake Superior, with the exception of the
block known as the Nannabijou Limits.&nbsp; This vast area of
pulpwood was considered the most desirable of all, and the
cutting rights there meant the domination of the pulp and paper
industry in Northern Ontario.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government had withheld the Nannabijou Limits from
being thrown on the market in deference to a pledge made to the
people by a former premier that it would never be leased until
the company tendering for it erected a mill at Kam City capable
of manufacturing into paper every stick of wood taken from
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The North Star until then had been an exporter, sending
most of its pulpwood to mills in eastern Canada in which it held
stock and to customers in United States.&nbsp; I had early
conceived that to make the North Star hold its place it must by
one means or another acquire the Nannabijou Limits.&nbsp; Before
the war, plans were all completed for the building of a pulp and
paper mill at Kam City to comply with the government
stipulation.&nbsp; The outbreak of hostilities, however, brought
about such chaos in the business world that the project had to be
abandoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My absence at the war and the consequent inactivity of
the North Star in the matter of expansion had given Gildersleeve
the opportunity he had been quietly watching for.&nbsp; When I
returned I discovered that he was organising international
capital on a large scale with the express purpose of securing the
rights on the Nannabijou.&nbsp; If he succeeded I knew too well
what it meant, and that would be the ultimate elimination of the
North Star as a factor on the upper lakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The North Star immediately purchased a site for a plant
in Kam City, let a contract for the erection of a pulp and paper
mill building and placed an order for the <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>necessary
machinery and equipment.&nbsp; With these proofs of our good
intentions we went to the provincial government and put in our
application for cutting rights on the Nannabijou.&nbsp; The Kam
City Pulp and Paper Company, subsidiary of the International
Investment Corporation, of which Gildersleeve had been made
president, simultaneously made a bid for the limits.&nbsp; They
too bought a site in Kam City and made preparations for the
erection of a mill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an established Canadian company employing hundreds
of workmen the year round, not to mention the lever we had in
political affairs, the advantage, at the start, was with us; but
parliament, as is the wont of parliaments, haggled over the
matter for many weary months.&nbsp; Finally, they awarded the
lease to the North Star, on a year to year basis, with a
particular stipulation that our mills be grinding wood from the
Nannabijou Limits at full capacity on October twenty-third of
this year.&nbsp; That would give us plenty of leeway, for we
expected to commence the installation of our machinery in
June.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange as it appeared at the time, the Kam City Pulp
and Paper Company continued their building operations with no
apparent prospect of limits to draw a raw supply from.&nbsp; I
suspected Gildersleeve had a card up his sleeve, but was at a
loss to determine what trickery he planned until the announcement
reached us that the company in the States which was building the
North Star&rsquo;s pulp and paper manufacturing machinery had
gone into liquidation and could not make delivery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was indeed a calamity, for the construction of
certain of the machines used in paper-making cannot be completed
in less than twenty-seven months&rsquo; time.&nbsp; Nowhere else
could we secure equipment anywhere within the time limit set by
the government.&nbsp; The full meaning <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>of the coup
that had been put over the North Star by its unscrupulous rival
was realised when we learned that the failure of the pulp and
paper machinery manufacturers with whom the North Star had its
order was brought about by money-market manipulators in
Gildersleeve&rsquo;s syndicate.&nbsp; By this underhand method
the Kam City Pulp and Paper Mills had actually gained possession
of the plant the North Star had on order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The North Star was faced with cancellation of its
rights on the limits and possible financial difficulties through
the immense amount of money it had invested in a mill that would
now be a white elephant on its hands.&nbsp; The Kam City Pulp and
Paper Company lost no time in drawing the attention of the
government to the fact that the North Star was installing no
machinery to grind the pulp poles it was booming at the limits;
and further that we had no machinery nor any prospect of securing
any.&nbsp; The Kam City Company applied for an order to restrain
the North Star from further cutting operations and again applied
for the lease under the former terms of offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The order of restraint was not issued, but the
government, after investigation, issued a fiat that in case the
Kam City Company were in a position to manufacture paper to the
full capacity demanded in the North Star&rsquo;s agreement, and
the North Star were not in that position, the rights of the North
Star on the Nannabijou Limits were to be cancelled and turned
over to the Kam City Company on October twenty-third.&nbsp;
Furthermore, the fiat ordained that the North Star could continue
cutting and booming poles at the limits until that date, if it so
desired; but it must make delivery of all poles cut in time and
in sufficient quantities to start the Kam City Company&rsquo;s
mills on contract time, and to keep them <a
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>running
full capacity until the opening of navigation the following
year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To their own surprise, as well as that of every one
else who had been following the news, the North Star&rsquo;s
legal representatives appearing before the legislature received
definite orders not to apply for an extension of time in the
matter of the North Star&rsquo;s agreement, nor to attempt to
protest the Kam City Company&rsquo;s right to the lease.&nbsp;
They were instructed instead to concentrate their efforts for the
inclusion of a clause in the government&rsquo;s agreement with
the Kam City Company specifying that, should the latter company
fail to make good to the letter in their contract by the date
named, from any cause whatsoever, the order giving them access to
the limits should be cancelled and the North Star should remain
in peaceful possession with the privilege of acquiring and
installing the necessary machinery at its mills as expeditiously
as might be within the bounds of reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That famous &lsquo;Act of God&rsquo; clause, as it has
since been nicknamed, was fought out for days on the floor of the
House; but the North Star finally won, its representatives
stressing the fact that the North Star had been arbitrarily dealt
with by the government because it had been debarred from
fulfilling its agreement through circumstances over which it had
no control, and, what was fair for an established company already
in possession, should be fair enough for an outside company which
was seeking to take its right away from it.&nbsp; The law-makers
at Toronto were sportsmen enough to see the point, though they
could not possibly see how we could benefit from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The public was quite as much at sea, and it was freely
conceded that the directing heads of the North Star were madmen,
though people who knew the North Star <a name="page310"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 310</span>intimately were contented to wait
and see what came out of it all.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>&ldquo;With the approach of the greatest crisis in the history
of the North Star, another important matter claimed immediate
attention.&nbsp; Your twenty-first birthday, Miss Stone, fell one
week before cancellation of the North Star&rsquo;s rights on the
limits must be prevented.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll confess that when I
sent you for in the name of &lsquo;J.C.X.&rsquo; I saw an
opportunity of thus mixing in a little more mystery to keep our
rivals guessing just what we were about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By an odd coincidence, Norman T. Gildersleeve and your
friend, Mr. Hammond, were bound for Kam City on the same train
that brought you from the West.&nbsp; The North Star&rsquo;s
intelligence department had been keeping close tab on
Gildersleeve.&nbsp; So far as I can gather, he must have gained
some vague notion as to the truth of the North Star&rsquo;s
direction and control.&nbsp; He had been filling our camps with
cheap private detectives of the transom and keyhole peeking type,
some of whom were entertained to exciting adventures but gained
no knowledge worth while.&nbsp; Gildersleeve was growing certain
the North Star had some trump card to play, and he thought to
take a leaf out of the North Star&rsquo;s book of methods to get
at the bottom of it and frustrate it.&nbsp; He concocted a wild
scheme of appearing to disappear personally and gain admission to
the limits in the disguise of a preacher.&nbsp; He was egotistic
enough to believe that what his detectives had failed in he could
accomplish himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our agents kept me apprised of his every move, even to
his inveigling young Hammond to undertake a seemingly mysterious
mission to the limits to divert attention from his own
operations.&nbsp; In many respects it appealed <a
name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>to me as a
nice bit of comedy, but Gildersleeve and Hammond were shadowed
day and night; the former for obvious reasons and the latter to
see that no harm befell him.&nbsp; Our newspapers meanwhile
published all sorts of conflicting news stories of
Gildersleeve&rsquo;s disappearance; much to the discomfiture of
Gildersleeve&rsquo;s one confidante, a Kam City lawyer named
Winch.&nbsp; Just by way of adding to the gaiety of nations, I
wrote an editorial on the subject of aphasia, inferring that it
was this trouble that had suddenly afflicted.&nbsp; Mr.
Gildersleeve and had it published in our string of dailies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gildersleeve might have been allowed to play out his
little fiasco to his heart&rsquo;s content for all the
interference it would have proved to the North Star&rsquo;s plans
had he not been rash enough to think he could spirit you away
from Amethyst Island right under our eyes.&nbsp; The plot was to
get Hammond to cultivate your acquaintance and thus unwittingly
lead you into the hands of a gang of low-brows who were to carry
you off in a yacht and keep you on the lake until after the
twenty-third of October.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should Mr. Gildersleeve have desired to carry
me off?&rdquo; cried Josephine Stone in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied Acey Smith, &ldquo;he believed
you were in some way essential to the plans the North Star had on
foot.&nbsp; His first and only attempt to seize you was staged in
the woods that day you made the trip up to the cliffs with Louis
Hammond.&nbsp; It was nipped in the bud, without either you or
Hammond knowing about it, by the North Star&rsquo;s faithful
Indian trackers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no second attempt because I took no further
chances.&nbsp; When I could not induce you to voluntarily leave
the island at once, I had you carried off by Ogima Bush, the only
man I could trust to handle so <a name="page312"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 312</span>delicate an undertaking.&nbsp; A
ruse used simultaneously to implicate Gildersleeve in his
disguise as the camp preacher worked so successfully that he was
arrested by the Mounted Police, and his company had to forfeit a
thousand dollars bail in order to get him out of jail and an
extremely embarrassing situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the beginning of the end.&nbsp; I went to
Montreal while the Gildersleeve crowd were frantically
concentrating their nimble brains to force a settlement of a
strike among the North Star&rsquo;s tugmen.&nbsp; In Montreal I
made final arrangements for the transfer of the estate of Joseph
Stone to his rightful heiress, Josephine Stone, after having had
the loan of it for the nineteen years it was left in my
trust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were just two little details left for me to
complete when I returned.&nbsp; The one was to give you an
account of the manner in which I managed your property while it
was held in trust and the other was to see that there were no
poles for the Kam City Pulp and Paper Mills to grind on the
twenty-third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led her to the edge of the cliff, pointing to the empty bay
in front of the camp below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Josephine Stone, &ldquo;the booms are
gone.&nbsp; What became of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They went out last night in the freshet caused by the
breaking of the beaver-dam in Solomon Creek during the
storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But those poles,&rdquo; questioned the girl,
&ldquo;weren&rsquo;t they very valuable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had not yet been paid for by the Kam City Company
and they were still the North Star&rsquo;s property,&rdquo; he
told her.&nbsp; &ldquo;And they can be salvaged&mdash;but by no
effort could they be salvaged to start the Kam City
Company&rsquo;s mills on time, much less to keep them in <a
name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>continuous
supply all winter.&nbsp; They will be salvaged to be ground and
manufactured into paper at the North Star&rsquo;s own mills next
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still the storm last night was an accident.&nbsp; If it
had not happened&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say it was the storm,&rdquo; he reminded
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just what made the beaver-dam go out will
always remain a mystery.&nbsp; Ogima Bush the Medicine Man, who
had led his Indians to believe the dam contained an evil spirit
that was bringing misfortune to them, held some sort of a pagan
incantation down there last night which might or might not
explain a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indians told Mrs. Johnson he was killed in the
storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;Ogima?&nbsp; Not much.&nbsp; Ogima Bush has
as many lives as a cat.&nbsp; But the chances are he&rsquo;ll
never be seen in this locality again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josephine Stone turned to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what about
yourself?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;In your account of the
North Star&rsquo;s operations and the final disposition of the
property you have not said one word as to the provisions made for
the man who engineered it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that too has been taken care of,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;During my trusteeship of the estate I drew
a salary quite commensurate with the services I rendered.&nbsp; I
made a few investments also that are turning out well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your plans for the future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not thought of that,&rdquo; Acey Smith answered,
his eyes fixing in that peculiar abstraction that made him an
enigma among men.&nbsp; &ldquo;Always I have had the gift of
visualising the future; of seeing clearly what was ahead of me
until now.&nbsp; But beyond what is now accomplished, beyond
to-day, everything appears like a void&mdash;a nothingness.&nbsp;
To put it that way, I feel like one who peruses the last chapters
of an exciting tale and knows, <a name="page314"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>though he has not yet seen the
author&rsquo;s finis, that the end is near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something tragically prophetic in his tones, a detachedness of
his manner and a realisation of his terrible loneliness of spirit
smote Josephine Stone.&nbsp; Her lips trembled and her eyes
filled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, little girl,&rdquo; he chided banteringly,
&ldquo;you must not cry on this of all your birthdays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she had turned from him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was
thinking,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;of Captain Alexander
Carlstone, the Man That Might Have Been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her shoulders were quivering.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s arms went
out as though to sweep her exquisite little form to him, but by a
tremendous effort of will he desisted and they dropped to his
side.&nbsp; A paroxysm went through his frame and his hands went
cupping to his mouth to muffle and strangle the cursed cry of the
loon that was rising in his throat.</p>
<p>When she turned his face was the old grim, sinister
mask.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; he urged almost
gruffly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had planned to have you reach Amethyst
Island early this afternoon and go over on a special tug to Kam
City as soon as you could get ready.&nbsp; The Indians are
waiting with a sedan in the bush just a few hundred yards below
the water-gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused suddenly in their progress toward the pathway
leading down from the summit.&nbsp; &ldquo;My pack-sack!&rdquo;
he exclaimed staring at the empty place where it had hung on the
little jackpine.</p>
<p>He strode over to the rim of the cliff and looked down.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Might have had better sense than to have hung it
there,&rdquo; he ruminated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wind shook it loose and
it has fallen down to the gully below.&nbsp; Oh, well, I&rsquo;ll
come back up for it after I see you down to the island.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll have to remember that.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
THE JUDGMENT OF THE LOWLY</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Josephine Stone</span> and Acey Smith
descended the cliff and walked to the upper tunnel at the
water-gate of the Cup of Nannabijou with scarcely a word uttered
between them.&nbsp; There was a host of things she wanted to say
to him and to ask him about, but his present mood entirely
precluded it.&nbsp; It made her feel like a child and baffled her
so that she was vexed at him and at herself.</p>
<p>In the tunnel he stopped to touch the secret button.&nbsp; As
the gong sounded he looked up at it quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;that sort
of prolonged twin-stroke.&nbsp; I never heard the bell ring just
that way before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the water in the channel had disappeared he helped her
down the steps.</p>
<p>They had progressed about half way, to the point where the
channel curved and the lower tunnel should next come into view on
the left, when the deep, vibrating alarum of the water-gate gong
sang out again.</p>
<p>At his startled gasp she turned and saw racing at them a great
wall of foaming, raging water.&nbsp; Josephine Stone screamed out
of very terror of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he cried as he drew her swiftly with
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is one way I may save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had a fleeting vision of a group of horror-stricken faces
at the lower tunnel&rsquo;s mouth, Hammond&rsquo;s among
them.</p>
<p><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>The
tunnel and the flight of steps running up to it were but a few
short paces away, but the raging, death-dealing torrent was
foaming at their very heels and the tunnel&rsquo;s mouth was high
above their reach.</p>
<p>Acey Smith stopped one instant.&nbsp; The next he seized her
below the knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stiffen out!&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>As the tide of water smote them she was conscious of being
thrust upward by his powerful arms, of his fingers releasing
themselves from her lower limbs and of her form being catapulted
unerringly through space to the mouth of the tunnel and into the
arms of Louis Hammond.</p>
<p>All went black for the briefest space.&nbsp; With a supreme
effort of will she warded off the fainting spell.</p>
<p>She, with the others, was looking with horrified fascination
into the channel where the water wall had swept on and ceased to
flow.&nbsp; On the wet rock bottom lay Acey Smith, face up, where
he had been flung by the torrent that was cut off too late.</p>
<p>His great proud form, which a moment ago had been flexing,
powerful muscles, was ominously inert, and from a corner of his
mouth trickled a crimson stream.</p>
<p>Willing arms carried him up the stone steps, through the
tunnel and out into the open.&nbsp; There they laid him gently
upon the sward.</p>
<p>The girl bent over him her hand feeling for his heartbeats as
she tenderly wiped the blood-stains from his mouth and cheek,
Hammond silently kneeling beside her.</p>
<p>At her touch Acey Smith&rsquo;s eyes fluttered and there came
a wan smile of recognition as he looked from the girl&rsquo;s
face to Hammond&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Tremblingly, he groped for a hand of each and brought them
together over his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Sandy Macdougal,&rdquo; he whispered weakly,
&ldquo;to <a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
317</span>come up and get my packsack.&nbsp; I could have
wished&mdash;to have lived&mdash;to kiss the bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heart of Josephine Stone was too full for words.&nbsp;
Silently, she stooped and pressed her warm lips to his chilling
ones.&nbsp; With scarcely a tremor the light left his face and he
was very still.</p>
<p>The spark that had been a man had fled.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Sandy Macdougal, who, by the way, afterwards discovered he was
the main beneficiary in Acey Smith&rsquo;s will, insisted on
going up alone to recover the packsack of the Big Boss.&nbsp;
What he found it to contain he told to no living being, but those
contents threw a light on another weird phase of the protagonist
soul of the Timber Pirate.&nbsp; In the pack, neatly parcelled,
were: a suit of coloured blanket-cloth trimmed with buck-skin
lacing, a pair of beaded shoe-packs, necklaces of wolves&rsquo;
teeth, a wig of long, coarse black hair with a purple band around
its crown holding a single eagle&rsquo;s feather at the back, a
bottle of stain that dyed the skin a copper hue, a stick of
blood-red grease-paint and a solution for quickly washing the
stain and the grease-paint from the face and hands.</p>
<p>Acey Smith who had been Alexander Carlstone was also Ogima
Bush the Medicine Man!</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>They buried Acey Smith on the crown of one of his native hills
where trails fork to the cardinal points of the compass into the
wild scenic grandeur he loved and called his home.&nbsp; There
the shore-wash of the great lake is within ear-shot on the one
side, while to the other the fantastic Laurentian ranges forever
lift their scarred <a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>and battered breasts to heaven as if in mute testimony
to the travail of man below.</p>
<p>On the mound above his resting-place the Indians set up a
great totem-pole bearing graven images and painted faces relating
his merits and his deeds, and on it they gave place for an
epitaph from the white workers of his camps and boats.</p>
<p>Because none knew of any faith he held to there was no
religious ceremony; but a little later there came a strange
company to pay last respects to one who had proved their friend
in the hours of dire need.&nbsp; There were aged ones, lame men
and blind men&mdash;and with them was a woman; she whose daughter
was a Mary Magdalene and had been snatched from the burning by
the strange, whimsical man that was gone.&nbsp; They brought with
them a few cheap wreaths as tributes of their regard; and, noting
the absence of Christian emblems, these simple people made of
birch boughs a little white cross which they planted in the
centre of the grave in soil hallowed by their tears.</p>
<p>The following year Mrs. Josephine Hammond, accompanied by her
husband, paid a visit to the grave to give instructions for the
placing of a more substantial and appropriate monument there to
the memory of Captain Alexander Carlstone, V.C.&nbsp; They found
that the wind and the sun had riven the great totem-pole, and the
frost had heaved its base so that it fell to one side.</p>
<p>But the little white birch cross of Christ&rsquo;s poor
remained firm in its place, where, in the evening shadow, it
gleamed steadfastly like the good that endures when might and
genius have passed away.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
